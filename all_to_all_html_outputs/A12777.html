streame from high rock tumbling downe<br/> And every drizling raine upon the loft,<br/> Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne<br/> Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:<br/> No other

There she stopt with teares;<br/> Her swollen hart her speech seemd to bereave,<br/> And then againe begonne, My weaker yeares<br/> Captived to fortune and frayle worldly feares<br/> Fly to your fayth for succour and sure ayde:<br/> Let me not die in languor and long teares. <br/>Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd? <br/>What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd? <br/><br/>Love of your selfe your selfe, she saide, and deare constraint<br/> Lets me not sleepe, but waste the wearie night<br/> In secret anguish and unpittied plaint,<br/> Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight. <br/>Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight<br/> Suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew,<br/> Her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight<br/> He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,<br/> That for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew. <br/><br/>Assure your selfe your selfe, it fell not all to ground;<br/> For all so deare as life is to my

wyde,<br/> That victory they dare not wish to either side. <br/><br/>At last the Paynim chaunst 〈◊〉 cast his eye,<br/> His suddein eye, flaming with wrathfull fyre,<br/> Vpon his brothers shield,

readie twise to fall;<br/> End of the doubtfull battaile deemed tho<br/> The lookers on, and lowd to him gan call<br/> The false Duessa, Thine the shield, and I, and all. <br/><br/>Soone as the Faerie heard his Ladie speake,<br/> Out of his swowning dreame he gan awake,<br/> And quickning faith, that earst was woxen weake,<br/> The creeping deadly cold away did shake:<br/> Tho moved with wrath, and shame, and Ladies sake,<br/> Of all attonce he cast avengd to be,<br/> And with so 'exceeding furie at him strake,<br/> That forced him to stoupe upon his knee;<br/> Had he not stouped so, he should have cloven bee. <br/><br/>And to him said, Goe now proud Miscreant,<br/> Thy selfe Thy selfe thy message do to german deare,<br/> Alone he wandring thee too long doth want:<br/> Goe say, his foe thy shield with his doth beare. <br/>Therewith his heavie 〈◊〉 he high gan reare,<br/> Him to have slaine; when lo a darkesome clowd<br/> Vpon him fell: he no where doth appeare,<br/> But 〈◊〉 is. The 〈◊〉 him calls 〈◊〉,<br/> But answer none receives: the darknes him does shrowd<br/><br/>In haste Duessa from her place arose,<br/> And to him running sayd, O prowest knight,<br/> That ever Ladie to her love did chose,<br/> Let now abate the terrour of your might,<br/> And quench the flame of furious despight,<br/> And bloodie vengeance; lo th'infernall powres<br/> Covering your foe with cloud of deadly night,<br/> Have borne him hence to Plutoes balefull bowres. <br/>The conquest yours, I yours, the shield, and glory yours. <br/><br/>Not all so satisfide, with greedy eye<br/> He sought all round about, his thristy blade<br/> To bathe in blood of faithlesse enimy;<br/> Who all that while lay hid in secret shade:<br/> He standes amazed, how he thence should fade. <br/>At last the trumpets Triumph sound on hie,<br/> And running Heralds humble homage made,<br/> Greeting him goodly with new victorie,<br/> And to him brought the shield, the cause of enmitie. <br/><br/>Wherewith he goeth to that soveraine Queene,<br/> And falling her before on lowly knee,<br/> To her makes present of his seruice seene:<br/> Which she accepts, with thankes, and goodly gree,<br/> Greatly aduauncing his gay chevalree. <br/>So marcheth home, and by her takes the knight,<br/> Whom all the people followe with great glee,<br/> Shouting, and clapping all their hands on hight,<br/> That all the ayre it fils, and flyes to heaven bright. <br/><br/>Home is he brought, and layd in sumptuous bed:<br/> Where many skilfull leaches him abide,<br/> To salue his hurts, that yet still freshly bled. <br/>In wine and oyle they wash his woundes wide,<br/> And softly gan embalme on everie side. <br/>And all the while, most heavenly melody<br/> About the bed sweet musicke did divide,<br/> Him to beguile of griefe and

his mothers bowelles, and it made<br/> His mortall mace, wherewith his foemen he dismayde. <br/><br/>That when the knight he spyde, he gan aduaunce<br/> With huge force and insupportable mayne,<br/> And towardes him with dreadfull fury praunce;<br/> Who haplesse, and eke hopelesse; all in vaine<br/> Did to him pace, sad battaile to darrayne,<br/> Disarmd, disgraste, and inwardly dismayde,<br/> And eke so faint in every joint and vayne,<br/> Through that fraile foūtain, which him feeble made,<br/> That scarsely could he weeld his bootlesse single blade. <br/><br/>The Geaunt strooke so maynly mercilesse,<br/> That could have overthrowne a stony towre,<br/> And were not hevenly grace, that him did blesse,<br/> He had beene pouldred all, as thin as flowre:<br/> But he was wary of that deadly stowre,<br/> And lightly lept from underneath the blow<br/> Yetso exceeding was the villeins powre<br/> That with the winde it did him overthrow,<br/> And all his sences stoond, that still he lay full low. <br/><br/>As when that divelish yron Engin wrought<br/> In deepest Hell,, and framd by Furies skill,<br/> With 〈◊〉 Nitre and quick Sulphur fraught,<br/> And ramd with bollet rownd, ordaind to kill,<br/> Conceiveth fyre, the heavens it doth fill<br/> With thundring noyse, and all the ayre doth choke,<br/> That none can breath, nor see, nor heare at will,<br/> Through smouldry cloud of duskish stincking smok,<br/> That th'onely breath him daunts, who hath escapt the stroke. <br/><br/>So daunted when the Geaunt saw the knight,<br/> His heavie hand he heaved upon hye,<br/> And him to dust thought to have battred quight,<br/> Vntill Duessa loud to him gan crye;<br/> O great Orgoglio, greatest under skye,<br/> O hold thy mortall hand for Ladies sake,<br/> Hold for my sake, and doe him not to dye,<br/> But vanquisht 〈◊〉 eternall bondflave make,<br/> And me thy worthy meed unto thy Leman take. <br/><br/>He hearkned, and did stay from further harmes,<br/> To gayneso goodly guerdon, as she spake:<br/> So willingly she came into his armes,<br/> Who her as willingly to grace did take,<br/> And was possessed of his newfound make. <br/>Then up he tooke the slombred sencelesse corse,<br/> And 〈◊〉 he could out of his swowne awake,<br/> Him to his castle brought with hastie forse,<br/> And in a Dongeon deep him threw without remorse. <br/><br/>From that day forth Duessa was his deare,<br/> And highly honourd in his haughtie eye,<br/> He gave her gold and purple pall to weare,<br/> And triple crowne set on her head full hye,<br/> And her endowd with royall maiestye:<br/> Then for to make her 〈◊〉 more of men. <br/>And peoples hartes with awfull terror tye,<br/> A monstrous beast ybredd in filthy fen<br/> He chose, which he had kept long time in darksom den. <br/><br/>Such one it was, as that renowmed Snake<br/> Which great Alcides in Stremona slew,<br/> Long fostred in the filth of Lerna lake,<br/> Whose many heades out budding ever new,<br/> Did breed him endlesse labor to subdew:<br/> But this same Monster much more ugly was;<br/> For seven great heads out of his body grew,<br/> An yron brest, and back of scaly bras,<br/> And all embrewd in blood, his eyes did shine as glas. <br/><br/>His tayle was stretched out in wondrous length,<br/> That to the hous of hevenly gods it raught,<br/> And with extorted powre, and borrowed strength,<br/> The everburning lamps from thence it braught,<br/> And prowdly threw to ground, as things of naught;<br/> And underneath his filthy feer did tread,<br/> The sacred thinges, and holy heastes foretaught. <br/>Vpon this dreadfull Beast with seven fold head<br/> He sett the false Duessa, for more aw and dread. <br/><br/>The wofull Dwarfe, which saw his maisters fall,<br/> Whiles he had keeping of his grasing steed,<br/> And valiant knight become a cay 〈◊〉 thrall,<br/> When all was past, tooke up his forlorne weed,<br/> His mightie Armour, missing most at need;<br/> His siluer shield, now idle maisterlesse;<br/> His poynant speare, that many made to bleed,<br/> The rvefull moniments of heavinesse,<br/> And with them all departes, to tell his great distresse. <br/><br/>He had not travaild long, when on 〈◊〉 way<br/> He wofull Lady, wofull Vna met,<br/> Fast flying from that Paynims greedy pray,<br/> Whilest Satyrane him from pursuit did let:<br/> Who when her eyes she on the Dwarf had set,<br/> And saw the signes, that deadly tydinges spake,<br/> She fell to ground for sorrowfull regret,<br/> And lively breath her sad brest did forsake,<br/> Yet might her pittcous hart be seene to pant and quake. <br/><br/>The messenger of so unhappie newes,<br/> Would faine have dyde: dead was his hart within,<br/> Yet outwardly some little comfort shewes:<br/> At last recovering hart, he does begin<br/> To rubb her temples, and to chaufe her chin,<br/> And everie tender part does tosse and turne:<br/> So hardly he the flitted life does win,<br/> Vnto her native prison to retourne:<br/> Then gins her grieved ghost thus to lament & mourne. <br/><br/>Ye dreaty instruments of dolefull sight,<br/> That doe this deadly spectacle behold,<br/> Why do ye lenger feed on loathed light,<br/> Or liking find to gaze on earthly mould,<br/> Sith cruell fates the carefull threds unfould,<br/> The which my life and love together tyde? <br/>Now let the stony dart of sencelesse cold<br/> Perce to my hart, and pas through everie side,<br/> And let eternall night so sad fro me hyde. <br/><br/>O light some day, the lampe of highest jove,<br/> First made by him, mens wandring wayes to guyde,<br/> When darknesse he in deepest 〈◊〉 drove,<br/> Henceforth 〈◊〉 hated face for ever hyde,<br/> And shut up heavens windowes shyning wyde:<br/> For earthly sight can nought but sorow breed,<br/> And late 〈◊〉, which shall long abyde. <br/>Mine eyes no more on 〈◊〉 shall feed,<br/> But seeled up with death, shall have their deadly meed. <br/><br/>Then downe againe she fell unto the ground;<br/> But he her quickly reared up againe:<br/> Thrise did she sinke 〈◊〉 in deadly swownd,<br/> And thrise he her 〈◊〉 with busie paine:<br/> At last when life recovered had the raine,<br/> And over-wrestled his strong enimy,<br/> With foltring tong, and trembling everie vaine,<br/> Tell on (quoth she) the wofull Tragedy,<br/> The which these reliques sad present unto mine eye. <br/><br/>Tempestuous fortune hath spent all her spight,<br/> And thrilling sorrow throwne his utmost dart;<br/> Thy sad tong cannot tell more heavy plight,<br/> Then that I seele, and harbour in mine hart:<br/> Who hath endured the whole, can beare ech part. <br/>If death it be, it is not the first wound,<br/> That launched hath my brest with bleeding smart<br/> Begin, and end the bitter balefull stound;<br/> Iflesse, then that I feare, more favour I have found. <br/><br/>Then gan the Dwarfe the whole discourse declare,<br/> The subtile traines of Archimago old;<br/> The wanton loves of false Fidessa fayre,<br/> Bought with the blood of vanquisht Paynim bold:<br/> The wretched payre transformd to 〈◊〉 mould;<br/> The house of Pryde, and 〈◊〉 round about;<br/> The combat, which he with Sansioy did hould;<br/> The lucklesse conflict with the Gyaunt 〈◊〉,<br/> Wherein captived, of life or 〈◊〉 he stood in doubt. <br/><br/>She heard with patience all unto the end,<br/> And strove to maister sorrowfull assay,<br/> Which greater grew, the more she did contend,<br/> And almost rent her tender hart in tway;<br/> And love fresh coles unto her fire did jay:<br/> For greater love, the greater is the losse. <br/>Was never Lady loved dearer day,<br/> Then she did love the knight of the Redorosse;<br/> For whose deare sake so many troubles her did tosse. <br/><br/>At last when feruent sorrow 〈◊〉 was,<br/> She up arose, resoluing him to find<br/> Alive or dead: and forward forth 〈◊〉 pas,<br/> All as the Dwarfe the way to her assynd:<br/> And ever more in constant carefull mind<br/> She fedd her wound with fresh 〈◊◊〉;<br/> Long tost with stormes, and bet with 〈◊〉 wind,<br/> High over hills, and lowe adowne the dale,<br/> She wandred many a wood, and measurd many a vale. <br/><br/>At last she 〈◊〉 by good 〈◊〉 to 〈◊〉<br/> A goodly knight, 〈◊◊〉 by the way<br/> Together with his 〈◊〉, 〈◊◊〉<br/> His glitterand armour shined far away,<br/> Like glauncing light of 〈◊〉

deare,<br/> And their for wasted kingdom to repayre:<br/> Whereto whenas they now approched neare,<br/> With hartie wordes her knight she gan to cheare,<br/> And in her modest maner thus bespake;<br/> Deare knight, as deare, as ever knight was deare,<br/> That all these sorrowes suffer for my sake,<br/> High heven behold the tedious toyle, ye for me take. <br/><br/>Now are we come unto my native

Dragon they espyde,<br/> Where stretcht he lay upon the sunny side,<br/> Of a great hill, himselfe like a great hill. <br/>But all so soone, as he from far descryde<br/> Those glistring armes, that heven with light did fill,<br/> He rousd himselfe full blyth, and hastned them untill. <br/><br/>Then badd the knight this Lady yede aloof,<br/> And to an hill her selfe her selfe withdraw asyde,<br/> From whence she might behold that battailles proof<br/> And ēke be safe from daunger far descryde:<br/> She him obayd, and turnd a litle wyde,<br/> Now O thou sacred Muse, most learned Dame,<br/>

Soone as thy dreadfull trompe begins to sownd;<br/> The God of warre with his fiers equipage<br/> Thou doest awake, sleepe never he so sownd,<br/> And feared nations doest with horror sterne astownd. <br/><br/>Fayre Goddesse lay that furious fitt asyde,<br/> Till I of warres and bloody Mars doe sing,<br/> And Bryton fieldes with Sarazin blood bedyde,<br/> Twixt that great faery Queene and Paynim king,<br/> That with their horror heven and earth did ring,<br/> A worke of labour long, and endlesse prayse:<br/> But now a while lett downe that haughtie string,<br/> And to my tunes thy second tenor rayse,<br/> That I this man of God his godly armes may blaze. <br/><br/>By this the dreadfull Beast drew nigh to hand,<br/> Halfe flying, and halfe footing in his haste,<br/> That with his largenesse measured much land,<br/> And made wide shadow under his huge waste;<br/> As mountaine doth the valley overcaste. <br/>Approching nigh, he reared high afore<br/> His body monstrous, horrible, and vaste,<br/> Which to increase his wondrous greatnes more,<br/> Was swoln with wrath, & poyson, & with bloody gore. <br/><br/>And over, all with brasen scales was armd,<br/> Like plated cote of steele, so couched neare,<br/> That nought mote perce, ne might his corse bee harmd<br/> With dint of swerd, nor push of pointed speare,<br/> Which as an Eagle, seeing pray appeare,<br/> His aery plumes doth rouze, full rudely dight,<br/> So shaked he, that horror was to heare,<br/> For as the clashing of an Armor bright,<br/> Such noyse his rouzed scales did send unto the knight. <br/><br/>His flaggy winges when forth he did display,<br/> Were like two sayles, in which the hollow wynd<br/> Is gathered full, and worketh speedy way:<br/> And eke the pennes, that did his pineons bynd,<br/> Were like mayne-yardes, with flying canuas kynd,<br/> With which whenas him list the ayre to beat,<br/> And there by force unwonted passage fynd,<br/> The clowdes before him fledd for terror great,<br/> And all the hevens stood still amazed with his threat. <br/><br/>His huge long tayle wownd up in hundred foldes,<br/> Does overspred his long bras-scaly back,<br/> Whose wreathed boughtes when ever he unfoldes,<br/> And thick entangled knots adown does slack,<br/> Bespotted all with shieldes of red and blacke,<br/> It sweepeth all the land behind him farre,<br/> And of three

exceed<br/> The sharpnesse of his cruel rending clawes;<br/> Dead was it sure, as sure as death in deed,<br/> What ever thing does touch his ravenous pawes,<br/> Or what within his reach he ever drawes. <br/>But his most hideous head my tongue to tell,<br/> Does tremble: for his deepe devouring iawes<br/> Wyde gaped, like the griesly mouth of hell,<br/> Through which into his darke abysse all ravin fell. <br/><br/>And that more wondrous was, in either iaw<br/> Three ranckes 〈◊〉 teeth enraunged were,<br/> In which yett trickling blood and gobbets raw<br/> Of late devoured bodies did appeare,<br/> That sight thereof bredd cold congealed feare:<br/> Which to increase, and all atonce to kill,<br/> A cloud of smoothering smoke and sulphure seare<br/> Out of his stinking gorge forth steemed still,<br/> That all the ayre about with smoke and stench did fill. <br/><br/>His blazing eyes, like two bright shining shieldes,<br/> Did burne with wrath, and sparkled living fyre;<br/> As two broad Beacons, sett in open fieldes,<br/> Send forth their flames far of to every shyre,<br/> And warning give, that enimies conspyre,<br/> With fire and sword the region to inuade;<br/> So flamed his eyne with rage and rancorous yre:<br/> But far within, as in a hollow glade,<br/> Those glaring lampes were sett, that made a dreadfull shade. <br/><br/>So dreadfully he towardes him did pas,<br/> Forelifting up a loft his speckled brest,<br/> And often bounding on the brused gras,<br/> As for great ioyaunce of his new come guest. <br/>Eftsoones he gan aduaunce his haughty crest,<br/> As chauffed Bore his bristles doth upreare,<br/> And shoke his scales to battaile ready drest;<br/> That made the Redcrosse knight nigh quake for feare,<br/> As bidding bold defyaunce to his foeman

wight;<br/> Yet had he proved the powre of many a pvissant knight. <br/><br/>Then with his waving wings displayed wyde,<br/> Himselfe up high he lifted from the ground,<br/> And with strong flight did forcibly divyde<br/> The yielding ayre, which nigh too feeble found<br/> Her flitting parts, and element unsound,<br/> To beare so great a weight: he cutting way<br/> With his broad sayles, about him soared round:<br/> At last low stouping with unweldy sway,<br/> Snatcht up both horse & man, to beare thē quite away. <br/><br/>Long he them bore above the subiect plaine,<br/> So far as Ewghen bow a

might,<br/> His wearie pounces all in vaine doth spend,<br/> To trusse the pray too heavy for his flight;<br/> Which comming down to ground, does free it selfe it selfe by fight. <br/><br/>He so disseized of his gryping grosse,<br/> The knight his thrillant speare againe assayd<br/> In his bras-plated body to embosse,<br/> And three mens strength unto the stroake he jayd;<br/> Wherewith the stiffe 〈◊〉 quaked, as affrayd,<br/> And glauncing from his scaly necke, did glyde<br/> Close under his left wing, then broad displayd. <br/>The percing steele there wrought a wound full wyde,<br/> That with the uncouth smart the Monster lowdly cryde. <br/><br/>He cryde, as raging seas are wont to rore,<br/> When wintry storme his wrathful wreck does threat,<br/> The rolling billowes beat the ragged shore,<br/> As they the earth would shoulder from her seat,<br/> And greedy gulfe does gape, as he would eat<br/> His neighbour element in his revenge:<br/> Then gin the blustring brethren boldly threat,<br/> To move the world from off his stedfast henge,<br/> And boystrous battaile make, each other to avenge. <br/><br/>The steely head stuck fast still in his flesh,<br/> Till with his cruell clawes he snatcht the wood,<br/> And quite a sunder broke. Forth flowed fresh<br/> A gushing river of blacke gory blood,<br/> That drowned all the land, whereon he stood;<br/> The streame thereof would drive a water-mill. <br/>Trebly angmented was his furious mood<br/> With bitter sence of his deepe rooted ill,<br/> That flames of fire he threw forth frō his large nosethril. <br/><br/>His hideous tayle then hurled he about,<br/> And therewith all enwrapt the nimble thyes<br/> Of his froth-fomy steed, whose courage stout<br/> Striving to loose the knott, that fast him tyes,<br/> Himselfe in streighter bandes too rash implyes,<br/> That to the ground he is perforce constraynd<br/> To throw his ryder: who can quickly ryse<br/> From of the earth, with durty blood distaynd,<br/> For that reprochfull fall right fowly he disdaynd. <br/><br/>And fercely tooke his trenchand blade in hand,<br/> With which he stroke so furious and so fell,<br/> That nothing seemd the pvissaunce could withstand:<br/> Vpon his crest the hardned yron fell,<br/> But his more hardned crest was armd so well,<br/> That deeper dint therein it would not make;<br/> Yet so extremely did the buffe him quell,<br/> That from thenceforth he shund the like to take,<br/> But when he saw them come, he did them still forsake. <br/><br/>The knight was wroth to see his stroke beguyld,<br/> And smot againe with more outrageous might;<br/> But backe againe the sparcling steele recoyld,<br/> And left not any marke, where it did light;<br/> As if in Adamant rocke it had beene pight,<br/> The beast impatient of his smarting wound,<br/> And of so fierce and forcible despight,<br/> Thought with his winges to stye above the ground;<br/> But his late wounded wing unseruiceable found. <br/><br/>Then full of griefe and anguish vehement,<br/> He lowdly brayd, that like was never heard,<br/> And from his wide devouring oven sent<br/> A flake of fire, that flashing in his beard,<br/> Him all amazd, and almost made afeard:<br/> The scorching flame sore swinged all his face,<br/> And through his armour all his body seard,<br/> That he could not endure so cruell cace,<br/> But thought his armes to leave, and helmet to unlace. <br/><br/>Not that great Champion of the antique world,<br/> Whom famous Poetes verse so much doth vaunt,<br/> And hath for twelue huge labours high extold,<br/> So many furies and sharpe fits did haunt,<br/> When him the poysoned garment did enchaunt<br/> With Centaures blood, and bloody verses charmd,<br/> As did this knight twelue thousand dolours daunt,<br/> Whom fyrie steele now burnt, that erst him armd,<br/> That erst him goodly armd, now most of all him harmd. <br/><br/>Faynt, wearie, sore, emboyled, grieved, brent<br/> With heat, toyle, wounds, armes, smart, & inward fire<br/> That never man such mischiefes did torment;<br/> Death better were, death did he oft desire,<br/> But death will never come, when needes require. <br/>Whom so dismayd when that his foe beheld,<br/> He cast to suffer him no more

They do arrive anone,<br/> Where sate a gentle Lady all alone,<br/> With garments rent, and heare discheveled,<br/> Wringing her handes, and making piteous mone;<br/> Her swollen eyes were much disfigured,<br/> And her faire face with teares was fowly blubbered. <br/><br/>The knight approching nigh, thus to her said,<br/> Fayre Lady, through fowle sorrow ill bedight,<br/> Great pitty is to see you thus dismayd,<br/> And marre the blossom of your beauty bright:<br/> For thy appease your griefe and heavy plight,<br/> And tell the cause of your conceived payne:<br/> For if he live, that hath you doen despight,<br/> He shall you doe dew recompence agayne,<br/> Or els his wrong with greater pvissance maintaine. <br/><br/>Which when she heard, as in despightfull wise,<br/> She wilfully her sorrow did augment,<br/> And offred hope of comfort did despise:<br/> Her golden lockes most cruelly she rent,<br/> And scratcht her face with ghastly dreriment,<br/> Ne would she speake, nesee, ne yet be seene,<br/> But hid her visage, and her head downe bent,<br/> Either for grievous shame, or for great 〈◊〉,<br/> As if her hart with sorow had transfixed beene. <br/><br/>Till her that Squyre bespake, Madame my life,<br/> For Gods deare love be not so wilfull bent,<br/> But doe vouchsafe now to receive reliefe,<br/> The which good fortune doth to you present. <br/>For what bootes it to weepe and to wayment,<br/> When ill is chaunst, but doth the ill increase,<br/> And the weake minde with double woe torment? <br/>When she her Squyre heard speake, she gan 〈◊〉<br/> Her voluntarie paine, and feele some secret ease. <br/><br/>〈◊〉 she said, Ah gentle trustie Squyre,<br/> What comfort can I wofull wretch conceave,<br/> Or why should ever I henceforth desyre,<br/> To see faire heavens face, and life not leave,<br/> Sith that false Traytour did my honour reave? <br/>False traytour certes (saide the Faerie knight)<br/> I read the man, that ever would deceave<br/> A gentle Lady, or her wrong through might:<br/> Death were too little paine for such a fowle despight. <br/><br/>But now, fayre Lady, comfort to you make,<br/> And read, who hath ye wrought this shamfull plight. <br/>That short revenge the man may overtake,<br/> Where so he be, and soone upon him light. <br/>Certes (saide she) I wote not, how he hight,<br/> But under him a gray steede he did wield,<br/> Whose sides with dapled circles weren dight;<br/> Vpright he rode, and in his siluer shield<br/> He bore a bloodie Crosse, that quartred all the field. <br/><br/>Now by my head (saide Guyon) much I muse,<br/> How that same knight should do so fowle amis,<br/> Or ever gentle Damzell so abuse:<br/> For may I boldly say, he surely is<br/> A right good knight, and trew of word ywis:<br/> I present was, and can it witnesse well,<br/> When armes he swore, and streight did enterpris<br/> Th'aduenture of the Errant damozell,<br/> In which he hath great glory wonne, as I heare tell. <br/><br/>Nathlesse he shortly shall againe be tryde,<br/> And fairely quit him of th'imputed blame,<br/> Els be ye sure he dearely shall abyde,<br/> Or make you good amendment for the same:<br/> All wrongs have mendes, but no amendes of shame. <br/>Now therefore Lady, rise out of your paine,<br/> And see the saluing of your blotting name. <br/>Full loth she seemd thereto, but yet did faine,<br/> For she was inly glad her purpose so to gaine. <br/><br/>Her purpose was not such, as she did faine,<br/> Ne yet her person such, as it was seene,<br/> But under simple shew and semblant plaine<br/> Lurkt false Duessa secretly unseene,<br/> As a chaste Virgin, that had wronged beene:<br/> So had false Archimago her disguysd,<br/> To cloke her guile with sorrow and sad teene;<br/> And eke himselfe had craftily devisd<br/> To be her Squire, and do her 〈◊〉 well aguisd. <br/><br/>Her late forlorne and naked he had found,<br/> Where she did wander in waste wildernesse,<br/> Lurking in rockes and caves far under ground,<br/> And with greene mosse cou'ring her nakednesse,<br/> To hide her shame and loathly filthinesse,<br/> Sith her Prince Arthur of proud ornaments<br/> And borrowd beauty spoyld. Her nathelesse<br/> Th'enchaunter finding fit for his intents,<br/> Did thus revest, and deckt with dew habiliments. <br/><br/>For all he did, was to deceive good knights,<br/> And draw them from pursuit of praise and fame,<br/> To slug in slouth and sensuall delights,<br/> And end their daies with irrenowmed shame. <br/>And now exceeding griefe him overcame,<br/> To see the Redcrosse thus aduaunced hye;<br/> Therefore this craftie engine he did frame,<br/> Against his praise to stirre up enmitye<br/> Of such, as vertues like mote unto him allye. <br/><br/>So now he Guyon guydes an uncouth way<br/> Through woods & mountaines, till they came at last<br/> Into a pleasant dale, that 〈◊〉 lay<br/> Betwixt two hils, whose high heads overplast,<br/> The valley did with coole 〈◊〉 overcast;<br/> Through midst thereof a little river rold,<br/> By which there sate a knight with helme unlaste,<br/> Himselfe refreshing with the liquid cold,<br/> After his travell long, and labours manifold. <br/><br/>Lo yonder he, cryde Archimage alowd,<br/> That wrought the shamefull fact, which I did shew,<br/> And now he doth himselfe in secret shrowd,<br/> To fly the vengeaunce for his outrage dew;<br/> But vaine: for ye shall dearely do him rew,<br/> So God ye speed, and send you good successe;<br/> Which we far off will here abide to vew. <br/>So they him left, inflamed with wrathfulnesse,<br/> That streight against that knight his speare he did addresse. <br/><br/>Who seeing him from far so fierce to pricke,<br/> His warlike armes about him gan embrace,<br/> And in the rest his ready speare did sticke;<br/> Tho when as still he saw him towards pace,<br/> He gan rencounter him in equall race:<br/> They bene ymett, both ready to affrap,<br/> When suddeinly that warriour gan abace<br/> His threatned speare, as if some new mishap<br/> Had him betide, or hidden danger did entrap. <br/><br/>And cryde, Mercie Sir knight, and mercie Lord,<br/> For mine offence and heedelesse hardiment,<br/> That had almost committed crime abhord,<br/> And with reprochfull shame mine honour shent,<br/> Whiles cursed steele against that badge I bent,<br/> The sacred badge of my Redeemers death,<br/> Which on your shield is set for ornament:<br/> But his fierce foe his steed could stay uneath,<br/> Who prickt with couragekene, did cruell battell breath<br/><br/>But when he heard him speake, streight way he knew<br/> His errour, and himselfe inclyning sayd,<br/> Ah deare Sir Guyon, well becommeth you,<br/> But me behoveth rather to upbrayd,<br/> Whose hastie hand so fat from reason strayd,<br/> That almost it did haynous violence<br/> On that fayre ymage of that heavenly Mayd,<br/> That decks and armes your shield with faire defence:<br/> Your court'sie takes on you anothers dew offence,<br/><br/>So beene they both at one, and doen upreare<br/> Their bevers bright, each other for to greet;<br/> Goodly comportaunce each to other beare,<br/> And entertaine themselues with court'sies meet;<br/> Then saide the Redcrosse knight, Now mote I weet,<br/> Sir Guyon, why with so fierce saliaunce,<br/> And fell intent ye did at earst me meet;<br/> For sith I know your goodly governaunce,<br/> Great cause, I weene, you guided, or some uncouth chaunce. <br/><br/>Certes (said he) well mote I shame to tell<br/> The fond encheason, that me hether led. <br/>A false infamous faitour late befell<br/> Me for to meet, that seemed ill bested,<br/> And playnd of grievous outrage, which he red<br/> A knight had wrought against a Ladiegent;<br/> Which to avenge, he to this place me led,<br/> Where you he made the marke of his intent,<br/> And now is fled, foule shame him follow, wher he went. <br/><br/>So can he turne his earnest unto game,<br/> Through goodly handling and wise temperaunce. <br/>By this his aged Guide in presence came,<br/> Who soone as one that knight his eye did glaunce,<br/> Eft soones of him had perfect cognizaunee,<br/> Sith him in Faery court he late avizd;<br/> And sayd, fayre sonne, God give you happy chaunce,<br/> And that deare Crosse uppon your shield devizd,<br/> Wherewith above all knights ye goodly seeme aguizd. <br/><br/>joy may you have, and everlasting fame,<br/> Of late 〈◊〉 hard atchieu'ment by you donne,<br/> For which enrolled is your glorious name<br/> In heavenly Regesters above the Sunne,<br/> Where you a Saint with Saints your seat have wōne:<br/> But wretched we, where ye have left your marke,<br/> Most now anew begin, like race to ronne;<br/> God guide thee, Guyon, well to end thy warke,<br/> And to the wished haven bring thy weary barke. <br/><br/>Palmer, him answered the Redcrosse knight,<br/> His be the praise, that this atchieu'ment wrought,<br/> Who made my hand the organ of his might;<br/> More then goodwill to me attribute nought:<br/> For all I did, I did but as I ought. <br/>But you faire Sir, whose pageant next ensewes,<br/> Well mote yee thee, as well can wish your thought,<br/> That home ye may report these happy newes;<br/> For well ye worthy bene for worth and gentle thewes. <br/><br/>So courteous conge both did give and take,<br/> With right hands plighted, pledges of good will. <br/>Then Guyon forward gan his voyage make,<br/> With his blacke Palmer, that him guided still. <br/>Still he him guided over dale and hill,<br/> And with his steedy staffe did point his way:<br/> His race with reason, and with words his will,<br/> From fowle intemperaunce he ofte did stay,<br/> And suffred not in wrath his hasty steps to stray. <br/><br/>In this faire wize they traveild long yfere,<br/> Through many hard assayes, which did betide,<br/> Of which he honour still away did beare,<br/> And spred his glory through all countryes wide. <br/>At last as chaunst them by a forest side<br/> To passe, for succour from the scorching ray,<br/> They heard a rvefull voice, that dearnly cride,<br/> With percing shriekes, and many a dolefull lay;<br/> Which to attend, awhile their forward steps they stay. <br/><br/>But if that carelesse hevens (qdshe) despise<br/> The doome of iust revenge, and <span class="links" link_data="1192,A68114">take</span> <span

Medina was her name,<br/> A sober sad, and comely courteous Dame;<br/> Who rich arayd, and yet in modest guize,<br/> In goodly garments, that her well became,<br/> Fayre marching forth in honorable wize,<br/> Him at the threshold mett, and well did enterprize. <br/><br/>She led him up into a goodly bowre,<br/> And comely courted with meet 〈◊〉,<br/> Ne in her speach, ne in her haviour,<br/> Was lightnesse seene, or looser vanitie,<br/> But gratious womanhood, and gravitie,<br/> Above the reason of her youthly yeares:<br/> Her golden lockes she roundly did uptye<br/> In breaded tramels, that no looser heares<br/> Did out of order stray about her daintie eares. <br/><br/>Whilest she her selfe her selfe thus busily did frame,<br/> Seemely to entertaine her new-come guest,<br/> Newes hereof to her other sisters came,<br/> Who all this while were at their wanton rest,<br/> Accourting each her frend with lavish fest:<br/> They were two knights of perelesse pvissaunce,<br/> And famous far abroad for warlike gest,<br/> Which to these Ladies love did countenaunce,<br/> And to his mistresse each himselfe strove to aduaunce. <br/><br/>He that made love unto the eldest Dame,<br/> Was hight Sir Huddibras, an hardy man;<br/> Yet not so good of deedes, as great of name,<br/> Which he by many rash aduentures wan,<br/> Since errant armes to sew he first began;<br/> More huge in strength, then wise in workes he was,<br/> And reason with foole-hardize over ran;<br/> Sterne melancholy did his courage pas,<br/> And was for terrour more, all armd in shyning bras. <br/><br/>But he that loved the youngest, was Sansloy,<br/> He that faire Vna late fowle outraged,<br/> The most unruly, and the boldest boy,<br/> That ever warlike weapons menaged,<br/> And to all lawlesse lust encouraged,<br/> Through strong opinion of his matchlesse might:<br/> Ne ought he cared, whom he endamaged<br/> By tortious wrong, or whom bereaved of right. <br/>He now this Ladies Champion chose for love to fight. <br/><br/>These two gay knights, vowd to so diverse loves,<br/> Each other does envy with deadly hate,<br/> And daily warre against his foeman moves,<br/> In hope to win more favour with his mate,<br/> And th'others pleasing seruice to abate,<br/> To magnifie his owne. But when they heard,<br/> How in that place straunge knight arrived late,<br/> Both knightes and ladies forth right angry fared,<br/> And fercely unto battell sterne themselues prepared. <br/><br/>But

suncke so deepe into their boyling brests,<br/> That downe they lett their cruell weapons fall,<br/> And lowly did abase their lofty crests<br/> To her faire presence, and discrete behests. <br/>Then she began a treaty to procure,<br/> And stablish termes betwixt both their requests,<br/> That as a law for ever should endure;<br/> Which to obserue in word of knights they did assure. <br/><br/>Which to confirme, and fast to bind their league,<br/> After their weary sweat and bloody toile,<br/> She them besought, during their quiet treague,<br/> Into her lodging to repaire a

froward twaine would accorage,<br/> And of her plenty adde unto their need:<br/> So kept she them in order, and her selfe her selfe in heed. <br/><br/>Thus fairely shee attempered her feast,<br/> And

him<br/> The wrath, which Atin kindled in his mind,<br/> Came to a river, by whose utmost brim<br/> Wayting to passe, he saw whereas did swim<br/> A long the shore, as swift as glaunce of eye,<br/> A litle Gondelay, bedecked trim<br/> With boughes and arbours woven cunningly,<br/> That like a litle forrest seemed outwardly. <br/><br/>And therein sate a Lady fresh and fayre,<br/> Making sweete solace to herselfe alone;<br/> Sometimes she song, as lowd as larke in ayre,<br/> Sometimes she laught, as merry as Pope jone,<br/> Yet was there not with her else any one,<br/> That to her might move cause of meriment:<br/> Matter of merth enough, though there were none<br/> She could devife, and thousand waies inuent,<br/> To feede her foolish humour, and vaine iolliment. <br/><br/>Which when far of Cymochles heard, and saw,<br/> He lowdly cald to such, as were abord,<br/> The little barke unto the shore to draw,<br/> And him to ferry over that deepe ford:<br/> The merry mariner unto his word<br/> Soone hearkned, and her painted bote streightway<br/> Turnd to the shore, where that same warlike Lord<br/> She in received; but Atin by no way<br/> She would admit, albe the knight her much

fly,<br/> Onely she turnd a pin, and by and by<br/> It cut away upon the yielding wave,<br/> Ne cared she her course for to apply:<br/> For it was taught the way, which she would have,<br/> And both from rocks and flats it selfe it selfe could wisely save. <br/><br/>And all the way, the wanton Damsell found<br/> New merth, her passenger to entertaine:<br/> For she in pleasaunt purpose did abound,<br/> And greatly ioyed merry tales to faine,<br/> Of which a store-house did with her remaine,<br/> Yet seemed, nothing well they her became;<br/> For all her wordes she drownd with laughter vaine,<br/> And wanted grace in utt'ring of the same,<br/> That turned all her pleasaunce to ascoffing game. <br/><br/>And other whiles vaine toyes she would devize,<br/> As her fantasticke wit did most delight,<br/> Sometimes her head she fondly would aguize<br/> With gaudy girlonds, or fresh flowrets dight<br/> About her necke, or rings of rushes plight;<br/> Sometimes to do him laugh, she would assay<br/> To laugh at shaking off the leaves light,<br/> Or to behold the water worke, and play<br/> About her little frigot, therein making way. <br/><br/>Her light behaviour, and loose dalliaunce<br/> Gave wondrous great contentment to the knight,<br/> That of his way he had no sovenaunce,<br/> Nor care of vowed revenge, and cruell fight,<br/> But to weake wench did yield his martiall might. <br/>So easie was to quench his flamed minde<br/> With one sweete drop of sensuall delight. <br/>So easie is, t'appease the stormy winde<br/> Of malice in the calme of pleasaunt womankind. <br/><br/>Diverse discourses in their way they spent,<br/> Mongst which Cymochles of her questioned,<br/> Both what she was, and what that usage ment,<br/> Which in her cott she daily practized. <br/>Vaine man (saide she) that wouldest be reckoned<br/> A straunger in thy home, and ignoraunt<br/> Of Phaedria (for so my name is red)<br/> Of Phaedria, thine owne fellow seruaunt;<br/>

<br/><br/>By this time was the worthy Guyon brought<br/> Vnto the other side of that wide strond,<br/> Where she was rowing, and for passage sought:<br/> Him needed not long call, shee soone to

Would oftentimes emongst them beare a part,<br/> And strive to passe (as she could well enough)<br/> Their native musicke by her skilful art:<br/> So did she all, that might his constant hart<br/> Withdraw from thought of warlike enterprize,<br/> And drowne in dissolute delights apart,<br/> Where noise of armes, or vew of martiall guize<br/> Might not reviue desire of knightly exercize. <br/><br/>But he was wise, and wary of her will,<br/> And ever held his hand upon his hart:<br/> Yet would not seeme so rude, and thewed ill,<br/> As to despise so curteous seeming part,<br/> That

Guy on evermore,<br/> Ne darkenesse him, ne daunger might dismay. <br/>Soone as he entred was, the dore streight way<br/> Did shutt, and from behind it forth there lept<br/> An ugly feend, more fowle then dismall day,<br/> The which with monstrous stalke behind him stept,<br/> And ever as he went, dew watch upon him kept. <br/><br/>Well hoped hee, ere long that hardy guest,<br/> If ever covetous hand, or lustfull eye,<br/> Or lips he layd on thing, that likte him best,<br/> Or ever sleepe his eiestrings did untye,<br/> Should be his pray. And therefore still on hye<br/> He over him did hold his cruell clawes,<br/> Threatning with greedy gripe to doe him 〈◊〉<br/> And rend in peeces with his ravenous pawes,<br/> If ever he transgrest the fatall Stygian lawes. <br/><br/>That houses forme within was rude and strong,<br/> Lyke an huge cave, hewne out of rocky clifte,<br/> From whose rough vaut the ragged breaches hong,<br/> Embost with massy gold of glorious guifte,<br/> And with rich metall loaded every rifte,<br/> That heavy rvine they did seeme to threatt;<br/> And over them Arachne high did lifte<br/> Her cunning web, and spred her subtile nett,<br/> Enwrapped in fowle smoke and clouds more black then jett. <br/><br/>Both roofe, and floore, and walls were all of gold,<br/> But overgrowne with dust and old decay,<br/> And hid in darkenes, that none could behold<br/> The hew thereof: for vew of cherefull day<br/> Did never in that house it selfe it selfe display,<br/> But a faint shadow of uncertein light;<br/> Such as a lamp, whose life does fade away:<br/> Or as the Moone cloathed with clowdy night,<br/> Does shew to him, that walkes in feare and sad affright. <br/><br/>In all that rowme was nothing to be seene,<br/> But huge great yron chests and coffers strong,<br/> All bard with double bends, that none could weene<br/> Them to efforce by violence or wrong:<br/> On every side they placed were along. <br/>But all the grownd with sculs was scattered,<br/> And dead mens bones, which round about were flōg,<br/> Whose lives, it seemed, whilome there were shed,<br/> And their vile carcases now leftunburied. <br/><br/>They forward passe, ne Guyon yet spoke word,<br/> Till that they came unto an yron dore,<br/> Which to them opened of his owne accord,<br/> And shewd of richesse such exceeding store,<br/> As eie of man did never see before,<br/> Ne ever could within one place be fownd,<br/> Though all the wealth, which is, or was of yore,<br/> Could gathered be through all the world arownd,<br/> And that above were added to that under grownd. <br/><br/>The charge thereof unto a covetous Spright<br/> Commaunded was, who thereby did attend,<br/> And warily awaited day and night,<br/> From other covetous feends it to defend,<br/> Who it to rob and ransacke did intend. <br/>Then Hammon turning to that warriour, said;<br/> Loe here the worldes blis, loe here the end,<br/> To which al men doe ayme, rich to be made:<br/> Such grace now to be happy, is before thee laid. <br/><br/>Certes (sayd he) I n'ill thine offred grace,<br/> Ne to be made so happy doe intend:<br/> Another blis before mine eyes I place,<br/> Another happines, another end. <br/>To them, that list, these base regardes I lend:<br/> But I in armes, and in atchievements brave,<br/> Do rather choose my flitting houres to spend,<br/> And to be Lord of those, that riches have,<br/> Then them to have my selfe my selfe, and be their seruile sclave. <br/><br/>Thereat the feend his gnashing teeth did grate,<br/> And grieved, so long to lacke his greedie pray;<br/> For well he weened, that so glorious bayte<br/> Would tempt his guest, to take thereof assay:<br/> Had he so doen, he had him snatcht away,<br/> More light then Culuer in the Faulcons fist. <br/>Eternall God thee save from such decay. <br/>But when as Mammon saw his purpose mist,<br/> Him to entrap unwares another way he wist. <br/><br/>Thence forward he him ledd, and shortly brought<br/> Vnto another rowme, whose dore forthright,<br/> To him did open, as it had beene taught:<br/> Therein an hundred raunges weren pight,<br/> And hundred fournaces all burning bright;<br/> By every fournace many feendes did byde,<br/> Deformed creatures, horrible in sight,<br/> And every feend his busie paines applyde. <br/>To melt the golden metall, ready to be tryde. <br/><br/>One with great bellowes gathered filling ayre,<br/> And with forst wind the fewell did inflame;<br/> Another did the dying bronds repayre<br/> With dying tongs, and sprinckled ofte the same<br/> With liquid waves, fiers Vulcans rage to tame,<br/> Who maystring them, renewd his former heat;<br/> Some scumd the drosse, that from the metall came. <br/>Some stird the molten owre with ladles great;<br/> And every one did swincke, and every one did sweat. <br/><br/>But when an earthly wight they present saw,<br/> Glistring in armes and battailous aray,<br/> From their whot work they did themselues withdraw<br/> To wonder at the sight: for till that day,<br/> They never creature saw, that cam that way. <br/>Their staring eyes sparckling with feruent fyre,<br/> And ugly shapes did nigh the man dismay,<br/> That were it not for shame, he would retyre,<br/> Till that him thus bespake their soveraine Lord & syre. <br/><br/>Behold, thou Faeries sonne, with mortall eye,<br/> That living eye before did never see:<br/> The thing, that thou didst crave so earnestly,<br/> To weet, whence all the wealth late shewd by mee,<br/> Proceeded, lo now is reveald to thee. <br/>Here is the fountaine of the worldes good:<br/> Now therefore, if thou wilt enriched bee,<br/> Auise thee well, and chaunge thy wilfull mood,<br/> Least thou perhaps hereafter wish, and be withstood. <br/><br/>Suffise it then, thou Money God (qd. hee)<br/> That all thine ydle offers I refuse. <br/>All that I need I have; what needeth mee<br/> To covet more, then I have cause to use? <br/>With such vaine shewes thy worldlinges vyle abuse:<br/> But give me leave to follow mine emprise. <br/>Mammon was much displeasd, yet no'te he chuse,<br/> But beare the rigour of his bold mesprise,<br/> And thence him forward ledd, him further to entise. <br/><br/>He brought him through a darksom narrow strayt,<br/> To a broad gate, all bvilt of beaten gold:<br/> The gate

ravisht with delight, to heare<br/> The royall Ofspring of his native land,<br/> Cryde out, Deare countrey, O how dearely deare<br/> Ought thy remembraunce, and perpetual band<br/> Be to thy foster Childe, thàt from thy hand<br/> Did commun breath and nouriture receave? <br/>How brutish is it not to understand,<br/> How much to her we owe, that all us gave,<br/> That gave unto us all, what ever good we have. <br/><br/>But Guyon all this while his booke did read,<br/> Ne yet has ended: for it was a great<br/> And ample volume, that doth far excead<br/> My leasure, so long leaves here to repeat:<br/> It told, how first Prometheus did create<br/> A man, of many parts from beasts deryved,<br/> And then stole fire from heven, to animate<br/> His worke, for which he was by jove depryved<br/> Of life him self him self, and hart-strings of an Aegle ryved. <br/><br/>That man so made, he called Elfe, to weet<br/> Quick, the first author of all Elfin kynd:<br/> Who wandring through the world with wearie feet,<br/> Did in the gardins of Adonis fynd<br/> A goodly creature, whom he deemd in mynd<br/> To be no earthly wight, but either Spright,<br/> Or-Angell, th'authour of all woman kynd;<br/> Therefore a Fay he her according hight,<br/> Of whom all Faryes spring, & fetch their lignage right. <br/><br/>Of these a mighty people shortly grew,<br/> And pvissant kinges, which all the world warrayd,<br/> And to them selues them selues all Nations did subdew:<br/> The first and eldest, which that scepter swayd,<br/> Was Elfin; him all India obayd,<br/> And all that now America men call:<br/> Next him was noble Elfinan, who laid<br/> Cleopolis foundation first of all:<br/> But Elfiline enclosd it with a golden wall. <br/><br/>His sonne was Elfinell, who overcame<br/> The wicked Gobbelines in bloody field:<br/> But Elfant was of most renowmed fame,<br/> Who all of Christall did Panthea bvild:<br/> Then Elfar, who two brethren gyauntes kild,<br/> The one of which had two heades, th'other three:<br/> Then Elfinor, who was in magick skild;<br/> He bvilt by art upon the glassy See<br/> A bridge of bras, whose sound heuēs thunder seemed to bee. <br/><br/>He left three sonnes, the which in order raynd,<br/> And all their Ofspring, in their dew descents,<br/> Euen seven hundred Princes, which maintaynd<br/> With mightie deedes their sondry governments;<br/> That were too long their infinite contents<br/> Here to record, ne much materiall:<br/> Yet should they be most famous moniments,<br/> And brave ensample, both of martiall,<br/> And civil rule to kinges and states imperiall. <br/><br/>After all these Elficleos did rayne,<br/> The wise Elficleos in great Maiestie,<br/> Who mightily that scepter did sustayne,<br/> And with rich spoyles and famous victorie,<br/> Did high aduaunce the crowne of Faery:<br/> He left two sonnes, of which faire Elferon<br/> The eldest brother did untimely dy;<br/> Whose emptie place the mightie Oberon<br/> Doubly supplide, in spousall, and dominion. <br/><br/>Great was his power and glorie over all,<br/> Which him before, that sacred seate did fill,<br/> That yet remaines his wide memoriall:<br/> He dying left the fairest Tanaquill,<br/> Him to succeede therein, by his last will:<br/> Fairer and nobler liveth none this howre,<br/> Ne like in grace, ne like in learned skill;<br/> Therefore they Glorian call that glorious flowre,<br/> Long mayst thou Glorian live, in glory & great powre. <br/><br/>Beguyld thus with delight of novelties,<br/> And naturall desire of countryes state,<br/> So long they redd in those antiquities,<br/> That how the time was fled, they quite forgate,<br/> Till gentle Alma seeing it so late,<br/> Perforce their studies broke, and them besought<br/> To thinke, how supper did them long awaite. <br/>So halfe unwilling from their bookes them brought,<br/> And fayrely feasted, as so noble knightes she ought. <br/>Cant XI<br/><br/><br/>The enimies of T

seene,<br/> And many arrowes under his right side,<br/> All deadly daungerous, all cruell keene,<br/> Headed with flint, and fethers bloody dide,<br/> Such as the Indians in their quivers hide,<br/> Those could he well direct and streight as line,<br/> And bid them strike the marke, which he had eyde,<br/> Ne was their salue ne was their medicine,<br/> That mote recure their wounds: so inly they

His Beast he felly prickt on either syde,<br/> And his mischievous bow full readie bent,<br/> With which at him a cruell shaft he sent:<br/> But he was warie, and it warded well<br/> Vpon his shield, that it no further went,<br/> But to the ground the idle quarrell fell:<br/> Then he another and another did expell. <br/><br/>Which to prevent, the Prince his mortall speare<br/> Soone to him raught, and fierce at him did ride,<br/> To be avenged of that shot whyleare:<br/> But he was not so hardy to abide<br/> That bitter stownd, but turning quicke aside<br/> His light-foot beast, fled fast away for feare:<br/> Whom to poursue, the Infant after hide,<br/> So fast as his good Courser could him beare,<br/> But labour lost it was, to weene approch him neare. <br/><br/>For as the winged wind his Tigre fled,<br/> That vew of eye could scarse him overtake,<br/> Ne scarse his feet on ground were seene to tred;<br/> Through hils and dales he speedy way did make,<br/> Ne hedge ne ditch his readie passage brake,<br/> And in his flight the villein turned his face,<br/> (As wonts the Tartar by the Caspian lake,<br/> When as the Russian him in fight does chace)<br/> Vnto his Tygres taile, and shot at him apace. <br/><br/>Apace he shot, and yet he fled apace,<br/> Still as the greedy knight nigh to him drew,<br/> And oftentimes he would relent his pace,<br/> That him his foe more fiercely should poursew:<br/> But when his uncouth manner he did vew,<br/> He gan avize to follow him no more,<br/> But keepe his standing, and his shaftes eschew,<br/> Vntill he quite had spent his perlous store,<br/> And then assayle him fresh, ere he could shift for more. <br/><br/>But that lame Hag, still as abroad he strew<br/> His wicked arrowes, gathered them againe,<br/> And to him brought fresh batteill to renew:<br/> Which he espying, cast her to restraine<br/> From yielding succour to that cursed Swaine,<br/> And her attaching, thought her hands to tye;<br/> But soone as him dismounted on the plaine,<br/> That other Hag did far away espye<br/> Binding her sister, she to him ran hastily. <br/><br/>And catching hold of him, as downe he lent,<br/> Him backeward overthrew, and downe him stayd<br/> With their rude handes and gryesly graplement,<br/> Till that the villein comming to their ayd,<br/> Vpon him fell, and lode upon him layd;<br/> Full litle wanted, but he had him

<br/><br/>They to him hearken, as beseemeth meete,<br/> And passe on forward: so their way does ly,<br/> That one of those same Islands, which doe fleet<br/> In the wide sea, they needes must passen by,<br/> Which seemd so sweet and pleasaunt to the eye,<br/> That it would tempt a man to touchen there:<br/> Vpon the banck they sitting did espy<br/> A daintie damsell, dressing of her heare,<br/> By whom a little skippet floting did appeare. <br/><br/>She them espying, loud to them can call,<br/> Bidding them nigher draw unto the shore;<br/> For she had cause to busie them withall;<br/> And therewith lowdly laught: But nathemore<br/> Would they once turne, but kept on as afore:<br/> Which when she saw, she left her lockes undight,<br/> And running to her boat wihtouten ore,<br/> From the

scornfully<br/> Scoffing at him, that did her iustly wite,<br/> She turnd her bote about, and from them rowed quite. <br/><br/>That was the wanton Phoedria, which late<br/> Did ferry him over the Idle

And of our safety good heede to take;<br/> For here before a perlous passage lyes,<br/> Where many Mermayds haunt, making false melodies. <br/><br/>But by the way, there is a great Quicksand,<br/> And a whirlepoole of hidden ieopardy,<br/> Therefore, Sir Palmer, keepe an even hand;<br/> For twixt them both the narrow way doth ly. <br/>Scarse had he saide, when hard at hand they spy<br/> That quicksand nigh with water covered;<br/> But by the checked wave they did descry<br/> It plaine, and by the sea discoloured:<br/> It called was the quickesand of Vnthriftyhed. <br/><br/>They passing by, a goodly Ship did see,<br/> Laden from far with precious merchandize,<br/> And bravely furnished, as ship might bee,<br/> Which through great disaventure, or mesprize,<br/> Her selfe Her selfe had ronne into that hazardize;<br/> Whose mariners and merchants with much toyle,<br/> Laboured in vaine, to have recured their prize,<br/> And the rich wares to save from pitteous spoyle,<br/> But neither toyle nor traveill might her backe recoyle. <br/><br/>On th'other side they see that perilous Poole,<br/> That called was the Whirlepoole of decay,<br/> In which full many had with haplesse doole<br/> Beene suncke, of whom no memorie did stay:<br/> Whose circled waters rapt with whirling sway,<br/> Like to a restlesse wheele, still 〈◊〉 round,<br/> Did covet, as they passed by that

all his bodie straine,<br/> That th'utmost sandy breach they shortly fetch,<br/> Whiles the dredd daunger does behind remaine. <br/>Suddeine they see from midst of all the Maine,<br/> The surging waters like a mountaine rise,<br/> And the great sea puft up with proud disdaine,<br/> To swell above the measure of his guise,<br/> As threatning to devoure all, that his powre despise. <br/><br/>The

toylesome wearinesse,<br/> But with his oares did sweepe the watry wildernesse. <br/><br/>And now they nigh approched to the sted,<br/> Where as those Mermayds dwelt: it was a still<br/> And calmy

stood to all,<br/> Which thether came: but in the Porch their sate<br/> A comely personage of stature tall,<br/> And semblaunce pleasing, more then naturall,<br/> That traveilers to him seemd to entize;<br/> His looser garment to the ground did fall,<br/> And flew about his heeles in wanton wize,<br/> Not fitt for speedy pace, or manly exercize. <br/><br/>They in that place him Genius did

all,<br/> That secretly doth us procure to fall,<br/> Through guilefull semblants, which he makes us see. <br/>He oft his Gardin had the governall,<br/> And Pleasures porter was devizd to bee,<br/> Holding a stafle in hand for more formalitee<br/><br/>With diverse flowres he daintily was deckt,<br/> And strowed rownd about, and by his side<br/> A mighty Mazer bowle of wine was sett,<br/> As if it had to him bene sacrifide;<br/> Wherewith all new-come guests he gratyfide:<br/> So did he eke Sir Guyon passing by:<br/> But he his ydle curtesie defide,<br/> And overthrew his bowle disdainfully;<br/> And broke his staffe, with which he charmed semblantssly. <br/><br/>Thus being entred, they behold arownd<br/> A large and spacious plaine, on every side<br/> Strowed with pleasauns, whose fayre grassy grownd<br/> Mantled with greene, and goodly beautifide<br/> With all the 〈◊〉 of Floraes pride,<br/> Wherewith her mother Art, as halfe in scorne<br/> Of niggard Nature, like a pompous bride<br/> Did decke her, and too lavishly adorne,<br/> When forth from virgin bowte she comes in th'early morne. <br/><br/>Therewith 〈◊〉 Heavens alwayes joviall,<br/> Lookte on them lovely, still in stedfast state,<br/> Ne fuffred storme nor frost on them to fall,<br/> Their tender buds or leaves to violate,<br/> Nor scorching heat, nor cold intemperate<br/> T'afflict the creatures, which therein did dwell,<br/> But the milde ayre with season moderate<br/> Gently attempred, and disposd so well,<br/> That still it breathed forth sweet spirit & holesom smell. <br/><br/>More sweet and holesome, then the pleasaunt hill<br/> Of Rhodope, on which the Nimphe, that bore<br/> A gyaunt babe, her selfe her selfe for griefe did kill:<br/> Or the Thessalian Tempe, where of yore<br/> Fayre Daphne Phoebus hart with love did gore;<br/> Or Ida, where the Gods loved to repayre,<br/> When ever they their heavenly bowres forlore;<br/> Or sweet Parnasse, the haunt of Muses fayre;<br/> Or Eden selfe, if ought with Eden mote compayre. <br/><br/>Much wondred Guyon at the fayre aspect<br/> Of that sweet place, yet suffred no delight<br/> To sincke into his sence, nor mind affect,<br/> But passed forth, and lookt still forward right,<br/> Brydling his will, and maystering his might:<br/> Till that he came unto another gate,<br/> No gate, but like one, being goodly dight<br/> With bowes and braunches, which did broad dilate<br/> Their clasping armes, in wanton wreathings intricate. <br/><br/>So fashioned a Porch with rare device,<br/> Archt over head with an embracing vine,<br/> Whose bounches hanging downe, seemd to entice<br/> All passers by, to taste their lushious wine,<br/> And did them selues them selues into their hands incline,<br/> As freely offering to be gathered:<br/> Some deepe empurpled as the Hyacine,<br/> Some as the Rubine, laughing sweetely red,<br/> Some like faire Emeraudes, not yet well ripened. <br/><br/>And them amongst, some were of burnisht gold,<br/> So made by art, to beautify the rest,<br/> Which did themselues emongst the leaves enfold,<br/> As lurking from the vew of covetous guest,<br/> That the weake boughes, with so rich load opprest,<br/> Did bow adowne, as overburdened. <br/>Vnder that Porch a comely dame did rest,<br/> Clad in fayre weedes, but fowle disordered,<br/> And garments loose, that seemd unmeet for womanhed. <br/><br/>In her left hand a Cup of gold she held,<br/> And with her right the riper fruit did reach,<br/> Whose sappy liquor, that with fulnesse sweld,<br/> Into her cup she scruzd, with daintie breach<br/> Of her fine fingers, without fowle empeach,<br/> That so faire winepresse made the wine more sweet:<br/> Thereof she usd to give to drinke to each,<br/> Whom passing by she happened to meet:<br/> It was her guise, all Straungers goodly so to greet. <br/><br/>So she to Guyon offred it to tast,<br/> Who taking it out of her tender hond,<br/> The cup to ground did violently cast,<br/> That all in peeces it was broken fond,<br/> And with the liquor stained all the lond:<br/> Whereat Excesse exceedinly was wroth,<br/> Yet no'te the same amend, ne yet withstond,<br/> But suffered him to passe, all were she loth;<br/> Who nought regarding her displeasure forward goth. <br/><br/>There the most daintie Paradise on ground,<br/> It selfe It selfe doth offer to his sobcr eye,<br/> In which all pleasures plenteously abownd,<br/> And none does others happinesse ennye:<br/> The painted flowres, the trees upshooting hye,<br/> The dales for shade, the hilles for breathing space,<br/> The trembling groves, the christ all running by;<br/> And that, which all faire workes doth most aggrace,<br/> The art, which all that wrought, appeared in no place. <br/><br/>One would have thought, (so cunningly, the rude<br/> And scorned partes were mingled with the fine,)<br/> That nature had for wantonesse ensude<br/> Art, and that Art at nature did repine;<br/> So striving each th'other to undermine,<br/> Each did the others worke more beautify;<br/> So diff'ring both in willes, agreed in fine:<br/> So all agreed through sweete diversity,<br/> This Gardin to adorne with all variety. <br/><br/>And in the midst of all, a fountaine stood,<br/> Of richest substance, that on earth might bee,<br/> So pure and shiny, that the siluer flood<br/> Through every channell running one might see;<br/> Most goodly it with curious ymageree<br/> Was overwrought, and shapes of naked boyes,<br/> Of which some seemd with lively iollitee,<br/> To fly about, playing their wanton toyes,<br/> Whylest others did them selues them selues embay in liquid ioyes,<br/><br/>And over all, of purest gold was spred,<br/> A trayle of yvie in his native hew:<br/> For the rich metall was so coloured,<br/> That wight, who did not well avised it vew. <br/>Would surely deeme it to bee yvie trew:<br/> Low his lascivious armes adown did creepe,<br/> That themselues dipping in the siluer dew,<br/> Their fleecy flowres they fearefully did steepe,<br/> Which drops of Christall seemd for wantones to weep. <br/><br/>Infinitstreames continually did well<br/> Out of this fountaine, sweet and faire to see,<br/> The which into an ample laver fell,<br/> And shortly grew to so great quantitie,<br/> That like a litle lake it seemd to bee;<br/> Whose depth exceeded not three cubits hight,<br/> That through the waves one might the bottom see,<br/> All paved beneath with jaspar shining bright,<br/> That seemd the fountaine in that sea did sayle upright. <br/><br/>And all the margent round about was sett,<br/> With shady Laurell trees, thence to defend<br/> The sunny beames, which on the billowes bett,<br/> And those which therein bathed, mote offend:<br/> As Guyon hapned by the same to wend,<br/> Two naked Damzelles he therein espyde,<br/> Which therein bathing, seemed to contend,<br/> And wrestle wantonly, ne cared to hyde,<br/> Their dainty partes from vew of any, which them eyd. <br/><br/>Sometimes the one would lift the other quight<br/> Above the waters, and then downe againe<br/> Her plong, as over maystered by might,<br/> Where both awhile would covered remaine,<br/> And each the other from to rise restraine;<br/> The whiles their snowy limbes, as through a vele,<br/> So through the christall waves appeared plaine:<br/> Then suddeinly both would themselues unhele,<br/> And th'a marous 'sweet spoiles to greedy eyes revele. <br/><br/>As that <span class="links" link_data="715,A16884">faire</span> <span class="links"

together yode. <br/><br/>But the captived Acrasia he sent,<br/> Because of traveill long, a nigher way,<br/> With a strong gard, all reskew to prevent,<br/> And her to Faery court safe to conuay,<br/> That her for witnes of his hard assay,<br/> Vnto his Faery Queene he might present:<br/> But he him selfe him selfe betooke another way,<br/> To make more triall of his hardiment,<br/> And seeke aduentures, as he with Prince Arthure went. <br/><br/>Long so they traveiled through wastefull wayes,<br/> Where daungers dwelt, and perils most did wonne,<br/> To hunt for glory and renowmed prayse;<br/> Full many Countreyes they did overronne,<br/> From the uprising to the setting Sunne,<br/> And many hard aduentures did atchieve;<br/> Of all the which they honour ever wonne,<br/> Seeking the weake oppressed to relieve,<br/> And to recover right for such, as wrong did 〈◊〉. <br/><br/>At last as through an open plaine they 〈◊〉,<br/> They spide a knight, that towards pricked fayre,<br/> And him beside an aged Squire there rode,<br/> That seemd to couch under his shield three-square,<br/> As if that age badd him that burden spare,<br/> And yield it those, that stouter could it wield:<br/> He them espying, gan him selfe him selfe prepare,<br/> And on his arme addresse his goodly shield<br/> That bore a Lion passant in a golden field. <br/><br/>Which seeing good Sir Guyon, deare besought<br/> The Prince of grace, to let him ronne that turne. <br/>He graunted: then the Faery quickly raught<br/> His poynant speare, and sharply gan to spurne<br/> His fomy steed, whose fiery feete did burne<br/> The verdant gras, as he thereon did tread;<br/> Ne did the other backe his foote returne,<br/> But fiercely forward came withouten dread,<br/> And bent his dreadful speare against the others head. <br/><br/>They beene ymett, and both theyr points arrived,<br/> But Guyon drove so furious and fell,<br/> That seemd both shield and plate it would have rived;<br/> Nathelesse it bore his foe not from his sell,<br/> Rut made him stagger, as he were not well:<br/> But Guyon selfe, ere well he was aware,<br/> Nigh a 〈◊〉 length behind his crouper fell,<br/> Yet in his fall so well him selfe him selfe he bare,<br/> That mischievous mischaūce his 〈◊〉 & limbs did spare. <br/><br/>Great shame and sorrow of that fall he tooke;<br/> For never yet, sith warlike armes he bore,<br/> And shivering speare in bloody field first shooke,<br/> He fownd him selfe him selfe dishonored so sore. <br/>Ah gentlest knight, that ever armor bore,<br/> Let not the grieve dismounted to have beene,<br/> And brought to grownd, that never wast before;<br/> For not thy fault, but secret powre unseene,<br/> That speare enchaunted was, which layd thee on the greene. <br/><br/>But weenedst thou, what wight thee overthrew,<br/> Much greater griefe and shamefuller regrett<br/> For thy hard fortune then thou wouldst renew,<br/> That of a single damzell thou wert mett<br/> On equall plaine, and there so hard besett;<br/> Euen the famous Britomart it was,<br/> Whom straunge aduentnre did from Britayne fett,<br/> To seeke her lover (love far sought alas,)<br/> Whose image shee had seene in Venus looking glas. <br/><br/>Full of disdainefull wrath, he fierce uprose,<br/> For to revenge that fowle reprochefull shame,<br/> And snatching his bright sword began to close<br/> With her on foot, and stoutly forward came;<br/> Dye rather would he, then endure that same. <br/>Which when his Palmer saw, he gan to feare<br/> His toward perill and untoward blame,<br/> Which by that new rencounter he should reare:<br/> For death sate on the point of that enchaunted speare. <br/><br/>And hasting towards him gan fayre perswade,<br/> Not to provoke misfortune, nor to weene<br/> His speares default to mend with cruell blade;<br/> For by his mightie Science he had seene<br/> The secrete vertue of that weapon keene,<br/> That mortall pvissaunce mote not withstond:<br/> Nothing

wyde,<br/> Whose hideous horror and sad trembling sownd<br/> Full griesly seemd: Therein they long did ryde,<br/> Yet tract of living creature none they fownd,<br/> Save Beares, Lyons, & Buls, which romed them arownd. <br/><br/>All suddenly out of the thickest brush,<br/> Vpon a milkwhite Palfrey all alone,<br/> A goodly Lady did foreby them rush,<br/> Whose face did seeme as cleare as Christall stone,<br/> And eke through feare as white as whales bone:<br/> Her garments all were wrought of beaten gold,<br/> And all her steed with tinsell trappings shone,<br/> Which fledd so fast, that nothing mote him hold,<br/> And scarse them leasure gave, her passing to behold. <br/><br/>Still as she fledd, her eye she backward threw,<br/> As fearing evill, that poursewd her fast;<br/> And her faire yellow locks behind her flew,<br/> Loosely disperst with puff of every blast:<br/> All as a blazing starre doth farre outcast<br/> His hearie beames, and flaming lockes dispredd,<br/> At sight whereof the people stand aghast:<br/> But the sage wisard telles, as he has redd,<br/> That it importunes death and dolefull dreryhedd. <br/><br/>So as they gazed after her a whyle,<br/> Lo where a griesly foster forth did rush,<br/> Breathing out beastly lust her to defyle:<br/> His tyreling jade he fiersly forth did push,<br/> Through thicke and thin, both over banck and bush<br/> In hope her to attaine by hooke or crooke,<br/> That from his gory sydes the blood did gush:<br/> Large were his limbes, and terrible his looke,<br/> And in his clownish hand a sharp bore speare he shooke. <br/><br/>Which outrage when those gentle knights did see,<br/> Full of great enuy and fell gealosy,<br/> They stayd not to avise, who first should bee,<br/> But all spurd after fast, as they mote

perlous Pace,<br/> With stedfast corage and stout hardiment;<br/> Ne evil thing she feard, ne evill thing she ment. <br/><br/>At last as nigh out of the wood she came,<br/> A stately Castle far away she spyde,<br/> To which her steps directly she did frame. <br/>That Castle was most goodly edifyde,<br/> And plaste for pleasure nigh that forrest syde:<br/> But faire before the gate a spatious playne,<br/> Mantled with greene, it selfe it selfe did spredden wyde,<br/> On which she saw six knights, that did darrayne<br/> Fiers battaill against one, with cruel might and mayne. <br/><br/>Mainely they all attonce upon him laid,<br/> And sore beset on every side arownd,<br/> That nigh he breathlesse grew, yet nought dismaid,<br/> Ne ever to them yielded foot of grownd<br/> All

That she is fairer, then our fairest Dame,<br/> As did this knight, before ye hether came. <br/>Perdy (said Britomart) the choise is hard:<br/> But what reward had he, that overcame? <br/>He should aduaunced bee to high regard,<br/> (Said they) and have our Ladies love for his reward. <br/><br/>Therefore a read Sir, if thou have a love. <br/>Love have I sure, (quoth she) but Lady none;<br/> Yet will I not fro mine owne love remove,<br/> Ne to your Lady will I seruice done,<br/> But wreake your wronges wrought to this knight alone,<br/> And prove his cause. With that her mortall speare<br/> She mightily aventred towards one,<br/> And downe him smot, ere well aware he weare,<br/> Then to the next she rode, & downe the next did beare. <br/><br/>Ne did she stay, till three on ground she layd,<br/> That none of them himselfe could reare againe;<br/> The fourth was by that other knight dismayd,<br/> All were he wearie of his former paine,<br/> That now

That for his trusty seruaunts doth so strongly fight,<br/><br/>Too well we see, (saide they) and prove too well<br/> Our faulty weakenes, and your matchlesse might:<br/> For thy, faire Sir, yours be the Damozell,<br/> Which by her owne law to your lot doth light,<br/> And we your liegemen faith unto you plight. <br/>So underneath her feet their swords they shard,<br/> And after her besought, well as they might,<br/> To enter in, and reape the dew reward:<br/> She graunted, and then in they all together fared. <br/><br/>Long were it to describe the goodly frame,<br/> And stately port of Castle

through a Chamber long and spacious,<br/> Eftsoones them brought unto their Ladies sight,<br/> That of them cleeped was the Lady of delight. <br/><br/>But for to tell the sumptuous aray<br/> Of that

framed were,<br/> And with great perles and pretious stones embost,<br/> That the bright glister of their beames cleare<br/> Did sparckle forth great light, and glorious did appeare. <br/><br/>These

stately manner when as they did see,<br/> The image of superstuous riotize,<br/> Exceeding much the state of meane degree,<br/> They greatly wondred, whence so sumpteous guize<br/> Might be maintaynd, and each gan diversely devize. <br/><br/>The wals were round about appareiled<br/> With costly clothes of Arras and of Toure,<br/> In which with cunning hand was pourtrahed<br/> The love of Venus and her Paramoure,<br/> The fayre Adonis, turned to a flowre,<br/> A worke of rare device, and wondrous wit. <br/>First did it shew the bitter balefull stowre,<br/> Which her assayd with many a feruent fit,<br/> When first her tender hart was with his beautie smit. <br/><br/>Then with what sleights and sweet allurements she<br/> Entyst the Boy, as well that art she knew,<br/> And wooed him her Paramoure to bee;<br/> Now making girlonds of each flowre that grew,<br/> To crowne his golden lockes with honour dew;<br/> Now leading him into a secret shade<br/> From his Beauperes, and from bright heavens vew,<br/> Where him to sleepe she gently would perswade,<br/> Or bathe him in a fountaine by some covert glade. <br/><br/>And whilst he slept, she over him would spred<br/> Her mantle, coloured like the starry skyes,<br/> And her soft arme lay underneath his hed,<br/> And with ambrosiall kisses bathe his eyes;<br/> And whilst he bathed, with her two crafty spyes,<br/> She secretly would search each daintie lim,<br/> And throw into the well sweet Rosemaryes,<br/> And fragrant violets, and Paunces trim,<br/> And ever with sweet Nectar she did sprinkle him. <br/><br/>So did she steale his heedelesse hart away,<br/> And ioyd his love in secret unespyde. <br/>But for she saw him bent to cruell play,<br/> To hunt the saluage beast in forrest wyde,<br/> Dreadfull of daunger, that mote him betyde,<br/> She oft and oft aduized him to refraine<br/> From chase of greater beastes, whose brutish pryde<br/> Mote breede him scath unwares: but all in vaine;<br/> For who can shun the chance, that dest'ny doth ordaine? <br/><br/>Lo, where beyond he lyeth languishing,<br/> Deadly engored of a great wilde Bore,<br/> And by his side the Goddesse groveling<br/> Makes for him endlesse mone, and evermore<br/> With her soft garment wipes away the gore,<br/> Which staynes his snowy skin with hatefull hew:<br/> But when she saw no helpe might him restore,<br/> Him to a 〈◊〉

sorrowes deepe<br/> Kept watch and ward about her warily,<br/> That nought she did but wayle, and often steepe<br/> Her dainty couch with teares, which closely she did 〈◊〉. <br/><br/>And if that any drop of slombring rest<br/> Did chaunce to still into her weary spright,<br/> When feeble nature felt her selfe her selfe opprest,<br/> Streight way with dreames, and with fantastick sight<br/> Of dreadfull things the same was put to flight,<br/> That oft out of her bed she did astart,<br/> As one with vew of ghastly feends affright:<br/> Tho gan she to renew her former smart,<br/> And thinke

<br/>Nor Prince, nor pere it is, whose love hath gryde<br/> My feeble brest of late, and launched this wound wyde. <br/><br/>Nor man it is, nor other living wight;<br/> For then some hope I might unto me draw,<br/> But th'only shade and semblant of a knight,<br/> Whose shape or person yet I never saw,<br/> Hath me subiected to loves 〈◊〉 law:<br/> The same one day, as me misfortune led,<br/> I in my fathers wondrous mirrhour saw,<br/> And pleased with that seeming goodly-hed,<br/> Vnwares the hidden hooke with baite I swallowed. <br/><br/>Sithens it hath infixed faster hold<br/> Within my bleeding bowells, and so sore<br/> Now ranckleth in this same fraile fleshly mould,<br/> That all mine entrailes flow with poisnous gore,<br/> And th'ulcer groweth daily more and more;<br/> Ne can my

Which all that while shee felt to pant and quake,<br/> As it an Earth-quake were, at last she thus bespake. <br/><br/>Beldame, your words doe worke me litle ease;<br/> For though my love be not so lewdly bent,<br/> As those ye blame, yet may it nought appease<br/> My raging smart, ne ought my flame relent,<br/> But rather doth my helpelesse griefe augment. <br/>Fòr they, how ever shamefull and unkinde,<br/> Yet did possesse their horrible intent:<br/> Short end of sorowes they therby did finde;<br/> So was their fortune good, though wicked were their minde. <br/><br/>But wicked fortune mine, though minde be good,<br/> Can have no end, nor hope of my desire,<br/> But feed on shadowes, whiles I die for food,<br/> And like a shadow wexe, whiles with entire<br/> Affection, I doe languish and expire. <br/>I fonder, then Cephisus foolish chyld,<br/> Who having vewed in a fountaine shere<br/> His face, was with the love thereof beguyld;<br/> I fonder love a shade, the body far exyld. <br/><br/>Nought like (quoth shee) for that same wretched boy<br/> Was of him selfe him selfe the ydle Paramoure;<br/> Both love and lover, without hope of ioy,<br/> For which he faded to a watry flowre. <br/>But better fortune thine, and better howre,<br/> Which lovest the shadow of a warlike knight;<br/> No shadow, but a body hath in powre:<br/> That body, wheresoever that it light,<br/> May learned be by cyphers, or by Magicke might. <br/><br/>But if thou may with reason yet represse<br/> The growing evill, ere it strength have gott,<br/> And thee abandond wholy doe possesse,<br/> Against it strongly strive, and yield thee nott,<br/> Til thou in open fielde adowne be smott. <br/>But if the passion mayster thy fraile might,<br/> So that needs love or death must bee thy lott,<br/> Then I avow to thee, by wrong or right<br/> To compas thy desire, and find that loved knight. <br/><br/>Her chearefull words much cheard the feeble spright<br/> Of the sicke virgin,

auncestrye,<br/> Till that by dew degrees and long protense,<br/> Thou have it lastly brought unto her Excellence. <br/><br/>Full many wayes within her troubled mind,<br/> Old Glauce cast, to cure this Ladies griefe:<br/> Full many waies she sought, but none could find,<br/> Nor herbes, nor charmes, nor counsel that is chiefe,<br/> And choisest med'cine for sick harts reliefe:<br/> For thy great care she tooke, and greater feare,<br/> Least that it should her turne to fowle repriese,<br/> And sore reproch, when so her father deare<br/> Should of his dearest daughters hard misfortune heare. <br/><br/>At last she her avisde, that he, which made<br/> That mirrhour, wherein the sicke Damosell<br/> So straungely vewed her straunge lovers shade,<br/> To weet, the learned Merlin, well could tell,<br/> Vnder what coast of heaven the man did dwell,<br/> And by what means his love might best be wrought:<br/> For though beyond the Africk Ismael,<br/> Or th'Indian Peru he were, she thought<br/> Him forth through infinite endevour to have sought. <br/><br/>Forth with them selues them selues disguising both in straunge<br/> And base atyre, that none might them bewray,<br/> To Maridunum, that is now by chaunge<br/> Of name Cayr-Merdin cald, they tooke their way:<br/> There the wise Merlin whylome wont (they say)<br/> To make his wonne, low underneath the ground,<br/> In a deepe delue, farre from the vew of day,<br/> That of no living wight he mote be found,<br/> When so he coūseld with his sprights encōpast round. <br/><br/>And if thou ever happen that same way<br/> To traveill, go to see that dreadful place:<br/> It is an hideous hollow cave (they say)<br/> Vnder a Rock that lyes a litle space<br/> From the swift, Barry, tombling downe apace,<br/> Emongst the woody hilles of Dynevowre:<br/> But dare thou not, I charge, in any cace,<br/> To enter into that same balefull Bowre,<br/> For feare the cruell Feendes should thee unwares devowre. <br/><br/>But standing high aloft, low lay thine eare,<br/> And there such ghastly noyse of yron chaines,<br/> And brasen Caudrons thou shalt rombling heare,<br/> Which thousand sprights with long enduring paines<br/> Doe tosse, that it will stonn thy feeble braines,<br/> And oftentimes great grones, & grievous stownds,<br/> When too huge toile and labour them constraines:<br/> And oftentimes loud strokes, and ringing sowndes<br/> From under that deepe Rock most horribly rebowndes. <br/><br/>The cause some say is this: A litle whyle<br/> Before that Merlin dyde, he did intend,<br/> A brasen wall in compas to compyle<br/> About Cairmardin, and did it commend<br/> Vnto these Sprights, to bring to perfect end. <br/>During which worke the Lady of the Lake,<br/> Whom long he loved, for him in hast did send,<br/> Who thereby forst his workemen to forsake,<br/> Them bownd till his retourne, their labour not to slake. <br/><br/>In the meane time through that false Ladies traine,<br/> He was surprisd, and buried under beare,<br/> Ne ever to his worke returnd againe:<br/> Nath'lesse those feends may not their work forbeare,<br/> So greatly his commandement they feare,<br/> But there doe toyle and traveile day and night,<br/> Vntill that brasen wall they up doe reare:<br/> For Merlin had in Magick more insight,<br/> Then ever him before or after living wight. <br/><br/>For he by wordes could call out of the sky<br/> Both Sunne and Moone, and make them him obay:<br/> The Land to sea, and sea to maineland dry,<br/> And darksom night he eke could turne to day:<br/> Huge hostes of men he could alone dismay,<br/> And hostes of men of meanest thinges could frame,<br/> When so him list his enimies to fray:<br/> That to this day for terror of his fame,<br/> The feends do quake, whē any him to them does name. <br/><br/>And sooth, men say that he was not the sonne<br/> Of mortall Syre, or other living wight,<br/> But wondrously begotten, and begonne<br/> By false illusion of a guilefull Spright,<br/> On a faire Lady Nonne, that whilome hight<br/> Matilda, daughter to Pubidius,<br/> Who was the Lord of Mathraval by right,<br/> And coosen unto king Ambrosius:<br/> Whence he indued was with skill so merueilous. <br/><br/>They here ariving, staid a while without,<br/> Ne durst aduenture rashly in to wend,<br/> But of their first intent gan make new dout<br/> For dread of daunger, which it might portend:<br/> Vntill the hardy Mayd (with love to frend)<br/> First entering, the dreadfull Mage there fownd<br/> Deepe busied bout worke of wondrous end,<br/> And writing straunge characters in the grownd,<br/> With which the stubborne seendes he to his seruice bownd. <br/><br/>He nought was moved at their entraunce bold:<br/> For of their comming well he wist afore,<br/> Yet list them bid their businesse to unfold,<br/> As if ought in this world in secrete store<br/> Were from him hidden, or unknowne of yore. <br/>Then Glauce thus, let not it thee offend,<br/> That we thus rashly through thy darksom dore,<br/> Vnwares have prest: for either fatall end,<br/> Or other mightie cause us two did hether send. <br/><br/>He bad tell on; And then she thus began. <br/>Now have three Moones with borrowd brothers light,<br/> Thrise shined faire, and thrise seemd dim and wan,<br/> Sith a sore evill, which this virgin bright<br/> Tormenteth, and doth plonge in dolefull plight,<br/> First rooting tooke; but what thing it mote bee,<br/> Or whence it sprong, I can not read aright:<br/> But this I read, that but if remedee,<br/> Thou her afford, full shortly I her dead shall see. <br/><br/>Therewith th'Enchaunter softly gan to smyle<br/> At her smooth speeches, weeting inly well,<br/> That she to him dissembled 〈◊〉 guyle,<br/> And to her said, Beldame, by that ye tell,<br/> More neede ofleach-crafte hath your Damozell,<br/> Then of my skill: who helpe may have elswhere,<br/> In vaine seekes wonders out of Magick spell. <br/>Th'old womā wox half blanck, those words to heare;<br/> And yet was loth to let her purpose plaine appeare. <br/><br/>And to him said, Yf any leaches skill,<br/> Or other learned meanes could have redrest<br/> This my deare daughters deepe engraffed ill,<br/> Certes I should be loth thee to molest:<br/> But this sad evill, which doth her infest,<br/> Doth course of naturall cause farre exceed,<br/> And housed is within her hollow brest,<br/> That either seemes some cursed witches deed,<br/> Or evill spright, that in her doth such torment breed. <br/><br/>The wisard could no lenger beare her bord,<br/> But brusting forth in laughter, to her sayd;<br/> Glauce, what needes this colourable word,<br/> To cloke the cause, that hath it selfe it selfe bewrayd? <br/>Ne ye fayre Britomartis, thus arayd,<br/> More hidden are, then Sunne in cloudy vele;<br/> Whom thy good fortune, having fate obayd,<br/> Hath hether brought, for succour to appele:<br/> The which the powres to thee are pleased to revele. <br/><br/>The doubtfull Mayd, seeing her selfe her selfe descryde,<br/> Was all abasht, and her pure yvory<br/> Into a cleare Carnation suddeine dyde;<br/> As fayre Aurora rysing hastily,<br/> Doth by her blushing tell, that she did lye<br/> All night in old Tithonus frosen bed,<br/> Whereof she seemes ashamed inwardly. <br/>But her olde Nourse was nought dishartened,<br/> But vauntage made of that, which Merlin had ared. <br/><br/>And sayd, Sith then thou knowest all our griefe,<br/> (For what doest not thou knowe?) of grace I pray,<br/> Pitty our playnt, and yield us meet reliefe. <br/>With that the Prophet still awhile did stay,<br/> And then his spirite thus gan foorth display;<br/> Most noble Virgin, that by fatall lore<br/> Hast learned to love, let no whit thee dismay<br/> The hard beginne, that meetes thee in the dore,<br/> And with sharpe fits thy tender hart oppresseth sore. <br/><br/>For so must all things excellent begin,<br/> And eke enrooted deepe must be that Tree,<br/> Whose big embodied braunches shall not lin,<br/> Till they to hevens hight forth stretched bee. <br/>For from thy wombe a famous Progenee<br/> Shall spring, out of the auncient Troian blood,<br/> Which shall reviue the sleeping memoree<br/> Of those same antique Peres, the hevens brood,<br/> Which Greeke & Asian rivers stayned with their blood. <br/><br/>Renowmed kings, and sacred Emperours,<br/> Thy fruitfull Ofspring, shall from thee descend;<br/> Brave Captaines, and most mighty warriours,<br/> That shall their conquests through all lands extend,<br/> And their decayed kingdomes shall amend:<br/> The feeble Britons, broken with long warre,<br/> They shall upreare, and mightily defend<br/> Against their forren foe, that commes from farre,<br/> Till universall peace compound all civill iarre. <br/><br/>It was not, Britomart, thy wandring eye,<br/> Glauncing unwares in charmed looking glas,<br/> But the streight course of hevenly destiny,<br/> Led with eternall

wandred through the forest wyde,<br/> To finde some issue thence, till that at last<br/> He met a Dwarfe, that seemed terrifyde<br/> With some late perill, which he hardly past,<br/> Or other accident, which him aghast;<br/> Of whom he asked, whence he lately came,<br/> And whether now he traveiled so fast:<br/> For sore he swat, and ronning through that same<br/> Thicke forest, was bescracht, & both his feet nigh lame. <br/><br/>Panting for breath, and almost out of hart,<br/> The Dwarfe him answerd, Sir, ill 〈◊〉 I stay<br/> To tell the same. I lately did depart<br/> From Faery court, where I have many a day<br/> Serued a gentle Lady of greatsway,<br/> And high accompt through out all Elfin land,<br/> Who lately left the same, and tooke this way:<br/> Her now I seeke, and if ye understand<br/> Which way she fared hath, good Sir tell out of hand. <br/><br/>What mister wight, (saide he) and how arayd? <br/>Royally clad (quoth he) in cloth of gold,<br/> As meetest may beseeme a noble mayd;<br/> Her faire lockes in rich circlet be enrold,<br/> A fayrer wight did never Sunne behold,<br/> And on a Palfrey rydes more white then snow,<br/> Yet she her selfe her selfe is whiter manifold:<br/> The surest signe, whereby ye may her know,<br/> Is, that she is the fairest wight alive, I trow. <br/><br/>Now certes swaine (saide he) such one I weene,<br/> Fast flying through this forest from her fo,<br/> A foule ill favoured foster, I have seene;<br/> Her selfe Her selfe, well as I might, I reskewd tho,<br/> But could not stay; so fast she did foregoe,<br/> Carried away with wings of speedy feare. <br/>Ah dearest God (quoth he) that is great woe,<br/> And wondrous ruth to all, that shall it heare. <br/>But can ye read Sir, how I may her finde, or where. <br/><br/>Perdy me lever were to weeten that,<br/> (Saide he) then ransome of the richest knight,<br/> Or all the good that ever yet I gat:<br/> But froward fortune, and too forward Night<br/> Such happinesse did, maulgre, to me spight,<br/> And fro me reft both life and light attone. <br/>But Dwarfe aread, what is that Lady bright,<br/> That through this forrest wandreth thus alone;<br/> For of her errour straunge I have great ruth and mone. <br/><br/>That Ladie is (quoth he) where so she bee,<br/> The bountiest virgin, and most debonaire,<br/> That ever living eye I weene did see;<br/> Lives none this day, that may with her compare<br/> In stedfast chastitie and vertue rare,<br/> The goodly ornaments of beautie bright;<br/> And is ycleped Florimell the fayre,<br/> Faire Florimell beloved of many a knight,<br/> Yet she loves none but one, that Marinell is hight. <br/><br/>A Sea-nymphes sonne, that Marinell is hight,<br/> Of my deare Dame is loved dearely well;<br/> In other none, but him, she sets delight,<br/> All her delight is set on Marinell;<br/> But he sets nought at all by Florimell:<br/> For Ladies love his mother long ygoe<br/> Did him, they say, forwarne through sacred spell. <br/>But fame now flies, that of a forreine foe<br/> He is yslaine, which is the ground of all our woe. <br/><br/>Five daies there be, since he (they say) was slaine,<br/> And fowre, since Florimell the Court forwent,<br/> And vowed never to returne againe,<br/> Till him alive or dead she did inuent. <br/>Therefore, faire Sir, for love of knighthood

At least eternall meede shall you abide. <br/>To whom the Prince; Dwarfe, comfort to thee take,<br/> For till thou tidings learne, what her betide,<br/> I here avow thee never to forsake. <br/>Ill weares he armes, that nill them use for Ladies sake. <br/><br/>So with the Dwarfe he backe retourned againe,<br/> To seeke his Lady, where he mote her finde;<br/> But by the way he greatly gan complaine<br/> The want of his good Squire late left behinde,<br/> For whom he wondrous pensive grew in minde,<br/> For doubt of daunger, which mote him betide;<br/> For him he loved above all mankinde,<br/> Having him trew and faithfull ever tride,<br/> And bold, as ever Squyre that waited by knights side. <br/><br/>Who all this while full hardly was assayd<br/> Of deadly daunger, which to him betidd;<br/> For whiles his Lord pursewd that noble Mayd,<br/> After that foster fowle he fiercely ridd,<br/> To bene avenged of the shame, he did<br/> To that faire Damzell: Him he chaced long<br/> Through the thicke woods, wherein he would have hid<br/> His shamefull head from his avengement strong,<br/> And oft him threatned death for his outrageous wrong. <br/><br/>Nathlesse the villein sped himselfe so well,<br/> Whether through swiftnesse of his speedie beast;<br/> Or knowledge of those woods, where he did dwell,<br/> That shortly he from daunger was releast,<br/> And out of fight escaped at the least;<br/> Yet not escaped from the dew reward<br/> Of his bad deedes, which daily he increast,<br/> Ne ceased not, till him oppressed hard<br/> The heavie plague, that for such leachours is prepard. <br/><br/>For soone as he was vanisht out of sight,<br/> His coward courage gan emboldned bee,<br/> And cast t'avenge him of that fowle despight,<br/> Which he had borne of his bold enimee. <br/>Tho to his brethren came: for they were three<br/> Vngratious children of one gracelesse syre,<br/> And unto them complayned, how that he<br/> Had used beene of that foolehardie Squyre;<br/> So them with bitter words he stird to bloodie yre. <br/><br/>Forthwith themselues with their sad instruments<br/> Of spoyle and murder they gan arme bylive,<br/> And with him foorth into the forrest went,<br/> To wreake the wrath, which he did earst reviue<br/> In their sterne brests, on him which late did drive<br/> Their brother to reproch and shamefull flight:<br/> For they had vowed, that never he alive<br/> Out of that forest should escape their might;<br/> Vile rancour their rude harts had fild with such despight<br/><br/>Within that wood there was a covert glade,<br/> Foreby a narrow foord, to them well knowne,<br/> Through which it was uneath for wight to made,<br/> And now by fortune it was overflowne:<br/> By that same way they knew that Squyre unknowne<br/> Mote algates passe; for thy themselues they set<br/> There in await, with thicke woods over growne,<br/> And all the while their malice they did whet<br/> With cruell threats, his passage through the ford to let. <br/><br/>It fortuned, as they devized had,<br/> The gentle Squyre came ryding that same way,<br/> Vnweeting of their wile and treason bad,<br/> And through the ford to passen did assay;<br/> But that fierce foster, which late fled away,<br/> Stoutly foorth stepping on the further shore,<br/> Him boldly bad his passage there to stay,<br/> Till he had made amends, and full restore<br/> For all the damage, which he had him doen afore. <br/><br/>With that at him a quiu'ring dart he threw,<br/> With so fell force and villeinous despite,<br/> That through his haberieon the forkehead flew,<br/> And through the linked mayles empierced quite,<br/> But had now powre in his soft flesh to bite:<br/> That stroke the hardy Squire did sore displease,<br/> But more that him he could not come to smite;<br/> For by no meanes the high banke he could sease,<br/> But laboured long in that deepe ford with vaine disease. <br/><br/>And still the foster with his long bore-speare<br/> Him kept from landing at his wished will,<br/> Anone one sent out of the thicket neare<br/> A cruell shaft, headed with deadly ill,<br/> And fethered with an unlucky quill;<br/> The wicked steele stayd not, till it did light<br/> In his left thigh, and deepely did it thrill:<br/> Exceeding griefe that wound in him empight,<br/> But more that with his foes he could not come to fight. <br/><br/>At last through wrath and vengeaunce making way,<br/> He on the bancke arryud with mickle payne,<br/> Where the third brother him did sore assay,<br/> And drove at him with all his might and mayne<br/> A forest bill, which both his hands did strayne,<br/> But warily he did avoide the blow,<br/> And with his speare requited him agayne,<br/> That both his sides were thrilled with the throw,<br/> And a large streame of flood out of the wound did flow. <br/><br/>He tombling downe, with gnashing teeth did bite<br/> The bitter earth, and bad to lett him in<br/> Into the balefull house of endlesse night,<br/> Where wicked ghosts doe waile their former sin. <br/>Tho gan the battaile freshly to begin;<br/> For nathemore for that spectacle bad,<br/> Did th'other two their cruell vengeaunce blin,<br/> But both attonce on both sides him bestad,<br/> And load upon him layd, his life for to have had. <br/><br/>Tho when that villayn he avized, which late<br/> Affrighted had the fairest Florimell,<br/> Full of fiers fury, and indignant hate,<br/> To him he turned, and with rigor fell<br/> Smote him so rudely on the Pannikell,<br/> That to the chin he clefte his head in twaine:<br/> Downe on the ground his carkas groveling fell;<br/> His sinfull sowle with desperate disdaine,<br/> Out of her fleshly ferme fled to the place of paine. <br/><br/>That seeing now the only last of three,<br/> Who with that wicked shafte him wounded had,<br/> Trembling with horror, as that did foresee<br/> The fearefull end of his avengement sad,<br/> Through which he follow should his brethren bad,<br/> His bootelesse bow in feeble hand upcaught,<br/> And therewith shott an arrow at the lad;<br/> Which fayntly fluttring, scarce his helmet raught,<br/> And glauncing fel to ground, but him annoyed naught. <br/><br/>With that he would have fled into the wood;<br/> But Timias him lightly overhent,<br/> Right as he entring was into the flood,<br/> And strooke at him with force so violent,<br/> That headlesse him into the foord he sent:<br/> The carcas with the streame was carried downe,<br/> Butch'head fell backeward on the Continent. <br/>So mischief fel upon the meaners crowne;<br/> They three be dead with shame, the Squire lives with renowne. <br/><br/>He lives, but takes small ioy of his renowne;<br/> For of that cruell wound he bled so sore,<br/> That from his steed he fell in deadly swowne;<br/> Yet still the blood forth gusht in so great store,<br/> That he lay wallowd all in his owne gore. <br/>Now God thee keepe, thou gentlest squire alive,<br/> Els

right? <br/>What seruice may I doe unto thee meete,<br/> That hast from darkenes me returnd to light,<br/> And with thy hevenly salues and med'cines sweete,<br/> Hast drest my sinfull wounds? I kisse thy blessed feete. <br/><br/>Thereat she blushing said, Ah gentle Squire,<br/> Nor Goddesse I, nor Angell, but the Mayd,<br/> And daughter of a woody Nymphe, desire<br/> No seruice, but thy safety and ayd,<br/> Which if thou gaine, I shalbe well apayd. <br/>Wee mortall wights, whose lives and fortunes 〈◊〉<br/> To commun accidents stil open layd,<br/> Are bownd with commun bond of frailtee,<br/> To succor wretched wights, whom we captived see. <br/><br/>By this her Damzells, which the former chace<br/> Had undertaken after her, arryved,<br/> As did Belphoebe, in the bloody place,<br/> And thereby deemd the beast had bene deprived<br/> Of life, whom late their ladies arrow ryved:<br/> For thy the bloody tract they followd fast,<br/> And every one to ronne the swiftest stryved;<br/> But two of them the rest far overpast,<br/> And where their Lady was, arrived at the last. <br/><br/>Where when they saw that goodly boy, wlth blood<br/> Defowled, and their Lady dresse his wownd,<br/> They wondred much, and shortly understood,<br/> How him in deadly case theyr Lady fownd,<br/> And reskewed out of the heavy stownd. <br/>Estsoones his warlike courser, which was strayd<br/> Farre in the woodes, whiles that he lay in swownd,<br/> She made those Damzels search, which being stayd,<br/> They did him set theron, and forth with them conuayd. <br/><br/>Into that forest farre they thence him led,<br/> Where was their dwelling, in a pleasant glade,<br/> With mountaines rownd about enuironed,<br/> And mightie woodes, which did the valley shade,<br/> And like a stately Theatre it made,<br/> Spreading it selfe it selfe into a spatious plaine. <br/>And in the midst a little river plaide<br/> Emongst the pumy stones, which seemd to plaine<br/> With gētle mnrmure, that their cours they did 〈◊〉<br/><br/>Beside the same a dainty place there lay,<br/> Planted with mirtle trees and laurells greene,<br/> In which the birds song many a lovely lay<br/> Of gods high praise, and of their sweet loves teene,<br/> As it an earthly Paradize had beene:<br/> In whose enclosed shadow there was pight<br/> A faire Pavilion, scarcely to be seene,<br/> The which was al within most richly dight,<br/> That greatest Princes liking it mote well delight. <br/><br/>Thether they brought that wounded Squyre, and 〈◊〉<br/> In easie couch his feeble limbes to rest,<br/> He rested him a while, and then the Mayd<br/> His readie wound with better 〈◊〉 new drest,<br/> Daily she dressed him, and did the best<br/> His grievous hurt to guarish, that she might,<br/> That shortly she his dolour hath redrest. <br/>And his foule sore reduced to faire plight:<br/> It she reduced, but himselfe destroyed quight. <br/><br/>O foolish physick, and unfruitfull paine,<br/> That heales up one and makes another wound:<br/> She his hurt thigh to him recurd againe,<br/> But hurt his hart, the which before was sound,<br/> Through an unwary dart, which did rebownd<br/> From her faire eyes and gratious countenaunce. <br/>What bootes it him from death to be unbownd,<br/> To be captived in endlesse duraunce<br/> Of sorrow and despeyre without aleggeaunce? <br/><br/>Still as his wound did gather, and grow hole,<br/> So still his hart woxe sore, and health decayd:<br/> Madnesse to save a part, and lose the whole. <br/>Still whenas he beheld the heavenly Mayd,<br/> Whiles dayly playsters to his wownd she layd,<br/> So still his Malady the more increast,<br/> The whiles her matchlesse beautie him dismayd. <br/>Ah God, what other could he doe at least,<br/> But love so fayre a Lady, that his life releast? <br/><br/>Long while he strove in his corageous brest,<br/> With reason dew the passion to subdew,<br/> And love for to dislodge out of his nest:<br/> Still when her excellencies he did vew,<br/> Her soveraine bountie, and celestiall hew,<br/> The same to love he strongly was constraynd:<br/> But when his meane estate he did renew,<br/> He from such hardy boldnesse was restraynd,<br/> And of his lucklesse lott and cruell love thus playnd. <br/><br/>Vnthankfull wretch (said he) is this the meed,<br/> With which her soverain mercy thou do est quight? <br/>Thy life she saved by her gratious deed,<br/> But thou do est weene with villeinous despight,<br/> To blott her honour, and her heavenly light. <br/>Dye rather, dye, then so disloyally<br/> Deeme of her high desert, or seeme so light:<br/> Fayre death it is to shonne more shame, to dy:<br/> Dye rather, dy, then ever love disloyally. <br/><br/>But if to love disloyalty it bee,<br/> Shall I then hate her, that from deathes dore<br/> Me brought? ah farre be such reproch fro mee. <br/>What can I lesse doe, then her love therefore,<br/> Sith I her dew reward cannot restore:<br/> Dye rather, dye, and dying doe her serue,<br/> Dying her serue, and living her adore;<br/> Thy life she gave, thy life she doth deserue:<br/> Dye rather, dye, then ever from her seruice swerue. <br/><br/>But foolish boy, what bootes thy seruice bace<br/> To her, to whom the hevens doe serue and sew? <br/>Thou a meane Squyre, of meeke and lowly place,<br/> She hevenly borne, and of celestiall hew. <br/>How then? of all love taketh equall vew:<br/> And doth not highest God vouchsafe to take<br/> The love and seruice of the basest crew? <br/>If she will not, dye meekly for her sake;<br/> Dye rather, dye, then ever so faire love forsake. <br/><br/>Thus warreid he long time against his will,<br/> Till that through weaknesse he was forst at last,<br/> To yield himselfe unto the mightie ill:<br/> Which as a victour proud, gan ransack fast<br/> His inward partes, and all his entrayles wast,<br/> That neither blood in face, nor life in hart<br/> It left, but both did quite drye up, and blast;<br/> As percing levin, which the inner part<br/> Of every thing consumes, and calcineth by art. <br/><br/>Which seeing fayre 〈◊〉, gan to feare,<br/> Least that his wound were inly well not heald,<br/> Or that the wicked steele empoysned were:<br/> Litle shee weend, that love he close conceald;<br/> Yet still he wasted, as the snow congeald,<br/> When the bright sunne his beams theron doth beat;<br/> Yet never he his hart to her reveald,<br/> But rather chose to dye for sorow great,<br/> Then with dishonorable termes her to entreat. <br/><br/>She gracious Lady, yet no paines did spare,<br/> To doe him ease, or doe him remedy:<br/> Many Restoratives of vertues rare,<br/> And costly Cordialles she did apply,<br/> To mitigate his stubborne malady:<br/> But that sweet Cordiall, which can restore<br/> A love-sick hart, she did to him enuy;<br/> To him, and to all th'unworthy world forlore<br/> She did enuy that soveraine salue, in secret store. <br/><br/>That 〈◊〉 Rose, the daughter of her Morne,<br/> More deare then life she tendered, whose flowre<br/> The girlond of her honour did adorne:<br/> Ne suffred she the Middayes scorching powre,<br/> Ne the sharp Northerne wind thereon to showre,<br/>

while<br/> Ye wonder, how this noble Damozell<br/> So great perfections did in her compile,<br/> Sith that in saluage forests she did dwell,<br/> So farre from court and royall Citadell,<br/> The great schoolmaistresse of all courtesy:<br/> Seemeth that such wilde woodes should far expell<br/> All civile usage and gentility,<br/> And gentle sprite deforme with rude rusticity. <br/><br/>But to this faire Belphoebe in her berth<br/> The hevens so favorable were and free,<br/> Looking with myld aspect upon the earth,<br/> In th'Horoscopeth'Horoscope of her nativitee,<br/> That all the gifts of grace and chastitee<br/> On her they poured forth of plenteous horne;<br/> jove laught on Venus from his soverayne see,<br/> And Phoebus with faire beames did her adorne,<br/> And all the Graces rockt her cradle being borne. <br/><br/>Her berth was of the wombe of Morning dew,<br/> And her conception of the ioyous Prime,<br/> And all her whole creation did her shew<br/> Pure and 〈◊〉 from all loathly crime,<br/> That is ingenerate in fleshly slime. <br/>So was this virgin borne, so was she bred,<br/> So was she trayned up from time to time,<br/> In all chaste vertue, and true bounti-hed<br/> Till to her dew perfection she were ripened. <br/><br/>Her mother was the faire Chrysogonee,<br/> The daughter of Amphisa, who by race<br/> A Faerie was, yborne of high degree,<br/> She bore Belphaebe, she bore in like cace<br/> Fayre Amoretta in the second place:<br/> These two were twinnes, & twixt them two did share<br/> The heritage of all celestiall grace. <br/>That all the rest it seemd they robbed bare<br/> Of bounty, and of beautie, and all vertues rare. <br/><br/>It were a goodly storie, to declare,<br/> By what straunge accident faire Chrysogone<br/> Conceived these infants, and how them she bore,<br/> In this wilde forrest wandring all alone,<br/> After she had nine moneths fulfild and gone:<br/> For not as other wemens commune brood,<br/> They were enwombed in the sacred throne<br/> Of her chaste bodie, nor with commune food,<br/> As other wemens babes, they sucked vitall blood. <br/><br/>But wondrously they were begot, and bred<br/> Through influence of th'hevens fruitfull ray,<br/> As it in antique bookes is mentioned. <br/>It was upon a Sommers 〈◊〉 day,<br/> When Titan faire his beames did display,<br/> In a fresh fountaine, 〈◊〉 from all mens vew,<br/> She bathed her brest, the boyling heat t'allay;<br/> She bathed with roses red, and violets blew,<br/> And all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew. <br/><br/>Till faint through yrkesome wearines, adowne<br/> Vpon the grassy ground her selfe her selfe she layd<br/> To sleepe, the whiles a gentle slombring swowne<br/> Vpon her fell all naked bare displayd;<br/> The sunbeames bright upon her body playd,<br/> Being through former bathing mollifide,<br/> And pierst into her wombe, where they embayd<br/> With so sweet sence and secret power unspide,<br/> That in her pregnant flesh they shortly fructifide. <br/><br/>Miraculous may seeme to him, that reades<br/> So straunge ensample of conception,<br/> But reason teacheth that the fruitfull seades<br/> Of all things living, through impression<br/> Of the sunbeames in moyst complexion,<br/> Doe life conceive and quickned are by kynd:<br/> So after Nilus inundation,<br/> Infinite shapes of creatures men doe fynd,<br/>

matter fit, which tempred right<br/> With heate and humour, breedes the living wight. <br/>So sprong these twinnes in womb of Chrysogone,<br/> Yet wist she nought thereof, but sore affright,<br/> Wondred to see her belly so upblone,<br/> Which still increast, till she her terme had full outgone. <br/><br/>Whereof conceiving shame and foule disgrace,<br/> Albe her guiltlesse conscience her cleard,<br/> She fled into the wildernesse a space,<br/> Till that unweeldy burden she had reard,<br/> And shund dishonor, which as death she feard:<br/> Where wearie of long traveill, downe to

fruitfull soyle of old,<br/> And girt in with two walls on either side;<br/> The one of yron, the other of bright gold,<br/> That none might thorough breake, nor over-stride:<br/> And double gates it had, which opened wide,<br/> By which both in and out men moten pas;<br/> Th'one faire and fresh, the other old and dride:<br/> Old Genius the porter of them was,<br/> Old Genius, the which a double nature has. <br/><br/>He letteth in, he letteth out to wend,<br/> All that to come into the world desire;<br/> A thousand thousand naked babes attend<br/> About him day and night, which doe require,<br/> That he with fleshly weeds would them attire:<br/> Such as him list, such as eternall fate<br/> Ordained hath, he clothes with sinfull mire,<br/> And sendeth forth to live in mortall state,<br/> Till they agayn returne backe by the hinder gate. <br/><br/>After that they againe retourned beene,<br/> They in that Gardin planted bee agayne;<br/> And grow afresh, as they had never seene<br/> Fleshly corruption, nor mortall payne. <br/>Some thousand yeares so doen they there remayne,<br/> And then of him are clad with other hew,<br/> Orsent into the chaungefull world agayne,<br/> Till thether they retourne, where first they grew:<br/> So like a wheele arownd they ronne from old to new. <br/><br/>Ne needs there Gardiner to sett, or sow,<br/> To plant or prune: for of their owne accord<br/> All things, as they created were, doe grow,<br/> And yet remember well the mighty word,<br/> Which first was spoken by th' Almighty lord,<br/> That bad them to increase and multiply:<br/> Ne doe they need with water of the ford,<br/> Or of the clouds to moysten their roots dry;<br/> For in themselues eternall moisture they imply. <br/><br/>Infinite shapes of creatures there are bred,<br/> And uncouth formes, which none yet ever knew,<br/> And every sort is in a sondry bed<br/> Sett by it selfe it selfe, and ranckt in comely rew:<br/> Some fitt for reasonable sowlest'indew,<br/> Some made for beasts, some made for birds to weare,<br/> And all the fruitfull spawne of fishes hew<br/> In endlesse rancks along enraunged were,<br/> That seemd the Ocean could not containe them there. <br/><br/>Daily they grow, and daily forth are sent<br/> Into the world, it to replenish more,<br/> Yet is the stocke not lessened, nor spent,<br/> But still remaines in everlasting store,<br/> As it at first created was of yore. <br/>For in the wide wombe of the world therelyes,<br/> In hatefull darknes and in deepe horrore,<br/> An huge eternal Chaos, which supplyes<br/> The substaunces of natures fruitfull progenyes. <br/><br/>All things from thence doe their first being fetch,<br/> And borrow matter, where of they are made,<br/> Which whenas forme and feature it does ketch,<br/> Becomes a body, and doth then inuade<br/> The state of life, out of the griesly shade. <br/>That substaunce is eterne, and bideth so,<br/> Ne when the life decayes, and forme does fade,<br/> Doth it consume, and into nothing goe,<br/> But chaunged is, and often altred to and froe. <br/><br/>The substaunce is not chaungd, nor altered,<br/> But th' only forme and outward fashion;<br/> For every substaunce is conditioned<br/> To chaunge her hew, and sondry formes to don<br/> Meet for her temper and complexion:<br/> For formes are variable and decay,<br/> By course of kinde, and by occasion;<br/> And that faire flowre of beautie fades away,<br/> As doth the lilly fresh before the sunny ray. <br/><br/><span class="links" link_data="734,A16884">Great</span>

woodes, that quite it overcame. <br/><br/>Through the tops of the high trees she did descry<br/> A litle smoke, whose vapour thin and light,<br/> Reeking aloft, uprolled to the sky:<br/> Which, chearefull signe did send unto her sight,<br/> That in the same did wonne some living wight. <br/>Eftsoones her steps she thereunto applyd,<br/> And came at last in weary wretched plight<br/> Vnto the

And that vile Hag, all were her whole delight<br/> In mischiefe, was much moved at so pitteous fight. <br/><br/>And gan recomfort her in her rude wyse,<br/> With 〈◊〉 compassion of her plaint,<br/> Wiping the teares from her suffused eyes,<br/> And bidding her sit downe, to rest her faint<br/> And wearie limbs a while. She nothing quaint<br/> Nors deignfull of so homely fashion,<br/> Sith brought she was now to so hard constraint,<br/> Sate downe upon the dusty ground anon,<br/> As glad of that small rest, as Bird

spright;<br/> T'adore thing so divine as beauty, were but right. <br/><br/>This wicked woman had a wicked sonne,<br/> The comfort of her age and weary dayes,<br/> A laesy loord, for nothing good to

He used to slug, or sleepe in slothfull shade:<br/> Such laesinesse both lewd and poore attonce him made. <br/><br/>He comming home at undertime, there found<br/> The fayrest creature, that he ever

On the bright Sunne unwares, doth soone withdraw<br/> His feeble eyne, with too much brightnes dazed,<br/> So stared he on her, and stood long while amazed. <br/><br/>Softly at last he gan his mother aske,<br/> What mister wight that was, and whence derived,<br/> That in so straunge disguizement there did maske,<br/> And by what accident she there arrived:<br/> But she, as one nigh of her wits deprived,<br/> With nought but ghastly lookes him answered,<br/> Like to a ghost, that lately is reviued<br/> From Stygian shores, where late it wandered;<br/> So both at her, and each at other wondered. <br/><br/>But the fayre Virgin 〈◊〉 so meeke and myld,<br/> That she to them 〈◊〉 to embace<br/> Her goodly port, and to their senses vyld,<br/> Her gentle speach applyde, that in short space<br/> She grew familiare in that desert place. <br/>During which time, the Chorle through her so kind<br/> And courteise use conceived affection bace,<br/> And cast to love her in his brutish mind,<br/> No love, but brutish lust, that was so beastly tind. <br/><br/>Closely the wicked flame his bowels brent,<br/> And shortly grew into outrageous fire;<br/> Yet had he not the hart, nor hardiment,<br/> As unto her to utter his desire;<br/> His caytive thought durst not so high aspire,<br/> But with soft sighes, and lovely semblaunces,<br/> He weened that his affection entire<br/> She should aread; many resemblaunces<br/> To her he made, and many kinde remembraunces. <br/><br/>Oft from the forrest wildings he did bring,<br/> Whose sides empurpled were with 〈◊〉,<br/> And oft young

brought to her in bands, as conpuered<br/> To be her thrall, his fellow seruant vild;<br/> All which, she of him tooke with countenance meeke & mild. <br/><br/>But past awhile, when she fit season saw<br/> To leave that desert mansion, she cast<br/> In secret wize her selfe her selfe thence to withdraw,<br/> For feare of mischiefe, which she did forecast<br/> Might by the witch or by her sonne compast:<br/> Her wearie Palfrey closely, as she might,<br/> Now well recovered after long repast,<br/> In his proud furnitures she freshly dight,<br/> His late miswandred wayes now to remeasure right. <br/><br/>And earely ere the dawning day appeard,<br/> She forth issewed, and on her iourney went;<br/> She went in perill, of each noyse affeard,<br/> And of each shade, that did it selfe it selfe present;<br/> For still she feared to be overhent,<br/> Of that vile hag, or her uncivile sonne:<br/> Who when too late awaking, well they kent,<br/> That their fayre guest was gone, they both begonne<br/> To make exceeding mone, as they had beene undonne. <br/><br/>But that lewd lover did the most lament<br/> For her depart, that ever man did heare;<br/> He knockt his brest with desperate intent,<br/> And scratcht his face, and with his teeth did teare<br/> His rugged flesh, and rent his ragged heare:<br/> That his sad mother seeing his sore plight,<br/> Was greatly woe begon, and gan to feare,<br/> Least his fraile senses were emperisht quight,<br/> And love to frenzy turnd, sith love is franticke hight. <br/><br/>All wayes shee sought, him to restore to plight,<br/> With herbs, with charms, with coūsel, & with teares,<br/> But tears, nor charms, nor herbs, nor counsell might<br/> Asswage the fury, which his entrails teares:<br/> So strong is passion, that no reason heares. <br/>Tho when all other helpes she saw to faile,<br/> She turnd her selfe her selfe backe to her wicked leares<br/> And by her divelish arts thought to prevaile,<br/> To bring her backe againe, or worke her finall bale. <br/><br/>Estesoones out of her hidden cave she cald<br/> An hideous beast, of horrible aspect,<br/> That could the stoutest corage have appald;<br/> Monstrous, mishapt, and all

rest, or breath at large,<br/> Till her she had attaind, and brought in place,<br/> Or quite devourd her beauties 〈◊〉 grace. <br/>The Monster swifte as word, that from her went,<br/> Went forth in haste, and did her footing trace<br/> So sure and swiftly, through his perfect sent,<br/> And passing speede, that shortly he her overhent. <br/><br/>Whom when the fearefull Damzell nigh espide,<br/> No need to bid her fast away to flie;<br/> That ugly shape so sore her terrifide,<br/> That it she shund no lesse, then dread to die,<br/> And her flitt Palfrey did so well apply<br/> His nimble feet to her conceived feare,<br/> That whilest his breath did strength to him supply,<br/> From perill free he her away did beare:<br/> But when his force gan faile, his pace gan wex areare. <br/><br/>Which whenas she perceived, she was dismayd<br/> At that same last extremity ful sore,<br/> And of her safety greatly grew afray d;<br/> And now she gan approch to the sea shore,<br/> As it

as the spoiles of my victorious games. <br/><br/>So well I to faire Ladies seruice did,<br/> And found such favour in their loving hartes,<br/> That ere the yeare his course had compassid,<br/> Thre hundred pledges for my good desartes,<br/> And thrise three hundred thanks for my good partes<br/> I with me brought, and did to her present:<br/> Which when she saw, more bent to eke my 〈◊〉,<br/> Then to reward my trusty true intent,<br/> She gan for me devise a grievous punishment. <br/><br/>To weet, that I my traveill should resume,<br/> And with like labour walke the world arownd,<br/> Ne ever to her presence should presume,<br/> Till I so many other Dames had fownd,<br/> The which, for all the svit I could propownd,<br/> Would me refuse their pledges to afford,<br/> But did abide for ever chaste and sownd. <br/>Ah gentle Squyre (quoth he) tell at one word,<br/> How many 〈◊〉 thou such to put in thy record? <br/><br/>In deed Sir knight (said he) one word may tell<br/> All, that I ever fownd so wisely stayd;<br/> For onely three they were disposd so well,<br/> And yet three yeares I now abrode have strayd,<br/> To fynd them out. Mote I (then laughing sayd<br/> The knight) inquire of thee, what were those three,<br/> The which thy proffred curtesie denayd? <br/>Or ill they seemed sure avizd to bee,<br/> Or brutishly brought up, that neu'r did fashions see. <br/><br/>The first which then refused me (said hee)<br/> Certes was but a common Courtisane,<br/> Yet 〈◊〉 refusd to have adoe with mee,<br/> Because I could not give her many a jane.  <br/>(Thereat full hartely laughed Satyrane)<br/> The second was an holy Nunne to chose,<br/> Which would not let me be her Chappellane,<br/> Because she knew, she sayd, I would disclose<br/> Her counsell, if she should her trust in me repose. <br/><br/>The third a Damzell was of low degree,<br/> Whom I in countrey cottage fownd by chaunce;<br/> Full litle weened I, that chastitee<br/> Had lodging in so meane a maintenaunce,<br/> Yet was she fayre, and in her countenaunce<br/> Dwelt simple truth in seemely fashion. <br/>Long thus I wooed her with dew obseruaunce,<br/> In hope unto my pleasure to have won,<br/> But was as far at last, as when I first begon. <br/><br/>Safe her, I never any woman found,<br/> That chastity did for it selfe it selfe embrace,<br/> But were for other causes firme and sound,<br/> Either for want of handsome time and place,<br/> Or else for feare of shame and fowle disgrace. <br/>Thus am I hopelesse ever to attaine<br/> My Ladies love, in such a desperate case,<br/> But all my dayes am like to waste in vaine,<br/> Seeking to match the chaste with th'unchaste Ladies traine. <br/><br/>Perdy, (sayd Satyrane) thou Squyre of Dames,<br/> Great labour fondly hast thou hent in hand,<br/> To get small thankes, and there with many blames,<br/> That may emongst Alcides labours stand. <br/>Thence bace returning to the former land,<br/> Where late he left the Beast, he overcame,<br/> He found him not; for he had broke his band,<br/> And was returnd againe unto his Dame,<br/> To tell what tydings of fayre Florimell became. <br/>Cant. VIII.<br/><br/><br/>The Witch creates a snowy Lady,<br/> like to Florimell,<br/> Who wrongd by Carle by Proteus saved,<br/> is sought by Paridell. <br/><br/>SO oft as I this history record,<br/> My hart doth melt with meere compassion,<br/> To thinke, how causelesse of her owne accord<br/> This gentle Damzell, whom I write upon,<br/> Should plonged be in such affliction,<br/> Without all hope of comfort or reliefe,<br/> That sure I weene, the hardest hart of stone,<br/> Would hardly finde to aggravate her griefe;<br/> For misery craves rather mercy, then repriefe. <br/><br/>But that accursed Hag, her hostesse late,<br/> Had so enranckled her malitious hart,<br/> That she desyrd th'abridgement of her fate,<br/> Or long enlargement of her painefull smart. <br/>Now when the Beast, which by her wicked art<br/> Late foorth she sent, she backe retourning spyde,<br/> Tyde with her golden girdle, it a part<br/> Of her rich spoyles, whom he had earst destroyd,<br/> She weend, & wondrous gladnes to her hart applyde. <br/><br/>And with it ronning hast'ly to her sonne,<br/> Thought with that sight him much to have relived;<br/> Who thereby deeming sure the thing as donne,<br/> His former griefe with furie fresh reviued,<br/> Much more then earst, and would have algates rived<br/> The hart out of his brest: for sith her dedd<br/> He surely dempt, himselfe he thought deprived<br/> Quite of all hope, wherewith he long had fedd<br/> His foolish malady, and long time had misledd. <br/><br/>With thought whereof, exceeding mad he grew,<br/> And in his rage his mother would have slaine,<br/> Had she not fled into a secret mew,<br/> Where she was wont her Sprightes to entertaine<br/> The maisters of her art: there was she faine<br/> To call them all in order to her ayde,<br/> And them coniure upon eternall paine,<br/> To counsell her so carefully dismayd,<br/> How she might heale her sonne, whose senses were decayd. <br/><br/>By their device, and her owne wicked wit,<br/> She there devized a wondrous worke to frame,<br/> Whose like on earth was never framed yit,<br/> That even Nature selfe enuide the same,<br/> And grudged to see the counterfet should shame<br/> The thing it selfe it selfe: In hand she boldly tooke<br/> To make another like the former Dame,<br/> Another Florimell, in shape and looke<br/> So lively and so like, that many it mistooke. <br/><br/>The substance, whereof she the body made,<br/> Was purest snow in massy mould congeald,<br/> Which she had gathered in a shady glade<br/> Of the Riphoean hils, to her reveald<br/> By errant Sprights, but from all men conceald:<br/> The same she tempred with fine Mercury,<br/> And virgin wex, that never yet was seald,<br/> And mingled them with perfect vermily,<br/> That like a lively sanguine it seemd to the eye. <br/><br/>In stead of eyes two burning lampes she set<br/> In siluer sockets, shyning like the skyes,<br/> And a quicke moving Spirit did arret<br/> To stirre and roll them, like to womens eyes;<br/> In stead of yellow lockes she did devyse,<br/> With golden wyre to weave her curled head;<br/> Yet golden wyre was not so yellow thryse<br/> As Florimells fayre heare: and in the stead<br/> Of life, she put a Spright to rule the carcas dead. <br/><br/>A wicked Spright yfraught with fawning guyle,<br/> And fayre resemblance above all the rest,<br/> Which with the Prince of Darkenes fell lome whyle;<br/> From heavens blis and everlasting rest,<br/> Him needed not instruct, which way were best<br/> Him selfe Him selfe to fashion likest Florimell,<br/> Ne how to speake, ne how to use his gest,<br/> For he in counterfesaunce did excell,<br/> And all the wyles of wemens wits knew passing well. <br/><br/>Him shaped thus, she deckt in garments gay,<br/> Which Florimell had left behind her late,<br/> That who so then her saw, would surely say,<br/> It was her selfe her selfe, whom it did imitate,<br/> Or fayrer then her selfe her selfe, if ought algate<br/> Might fayrer be. And then she forth her brought<br/> Vnto her sonne, that lay in feeble state;<br/> Who seeing her gan streight upstart, and thought<br/> She was the Lady selfe, who he so long had sought. <br/><br/>Tho fast her clipping twixt his armes twayne,<br/> Extremely ioyed in so happy sight,<br/> And soone forgot his former sickely payne;<br/> But she, the more to seeme such as she hight,<br/> Coyly rebutted his embracement light;<br/> Yet still with gentle countenaunce retained,<br/> Enough to hold a foole in vaine delight:<br/> Him long she so with shadowes entertained,<br/> As her Creatresse had in charge to her ordained. <br/><br/>Till on a day, as he disposed was<br/> To walke the woodes with that his Idole faire,<br/> Her to disport, and idle time to pas,<br/> In th'open freshnes of the gentle aire,<br/> A knight that way there chaunced to repaire;<br/> Yet knight he was not, but a boastfull swaine,<br/> That deedes of armes had ever in despaire,<br/> Proud Braggadocchio, that in vaunting vaine<br/> His glory did repose, and credit did maintaine. <br/><br/>He seeing with that Chorle so faire a wight,<br/> Decked with many a costly ornament,<br/> Much merueiled thereat, as well he might,<br/> And thought that match a fowle disparagement:<br/> His bloody speare eftesoones he boldly bent<br/> Against the silly clowne, who dead through feare,<br/> Fell streight to ground in great astonishment;<br/> Villein (sayd he) this Lady is my deare,<br/> Dy, if thou it gainesay: I will away her beare. <br/><br/>The fearefull Chorle durst not gainesay, nor dooe,<br/> But trembling stood, and yielded him the pray;<br/> Who finding litle leasure her to wooe,<br/> On Tromparts steed her mounted without stay,<br/> And without reskew led her quite away. <br/>Proud man himselfe then Braggadochio deemed,<br/> And next to none, after that happy day,<br/> Being possessed of that spoyle, which seemed<br/> The fairest wight on ground, and most of men esteemed. <br/><br/>But when hee saw him selfe him selfe free from poursute,<br/> He gan make gentle purpose to his Dame,<br/> With termes of love and lewdnesse dissolute;<br/> For he could well his glozing speaches frame<br/> To such vaine uses, that him best became:<br/> But she thereto would lend but light regard,<br/> As seeming sory, that she ever came<br/> Into his powre, that used her so hard,<br/> To reave her honor, which she more then life prefard. <br/><br/>Thus as they two of kindnes treated long,<br/> There them by chaunce encountred on the way<br/> An armed knight, upon a courser strong,<br/> Whose trampling feete upon the hollow lay<br/> Seemed to thunder, and did nigh affray<br/> That Capons corage: yet he looked grim,<br/> And faynd to cheare his lady in dismay,<br/> Who seemd for feare to quake in every lim,<br/> And her to save from outrage, meekely prayed him. <br/><br/>Fiercely that straunger forward came, and nigh<br/> Approching, with bold words and bitter threat,<br/> Bad that same boaster, as he mote, on high<br/> To leave to him that lady for excheat,<br/> Or bide him batteill without further treat. <br/>That challenge did too peremptory seeme,<br/> And fild his senses with abashment great;<br/> Yet seeing nigh him ieopardy extreme,<br/> He it dissembled well, and light seemd to esteeme. <br/><br/>Saying, Thou foolish knight, that weenst with words<br/> To steale away, that I with blowes have wonne,<br/> And broght throgh points of many perilous swords:<br/> But if thee list to see thy Courser ronne,<br/> Or prove thy selfe thy selfe, this sad encounter shonne,<br/> And seeke els without hazard of thy hedd. <br/>At those prowd words that other knight begonne<br/> To wex exceeding wroth, and him aredd<br/> To turne his steede about, or sure he should be dedd. <br/><br/>Sith then (said Braggadochio) needes thou wilt<br/> Thy daies abridge, through proofe of pvissaunce,<br/> Turne we our steeds, that both in equall tilt<br/> May meete againe, and each take happy chaunce. <br/>This said they both a furlongs mountenaunce<br/> Retird their steeds, to ronne in even race:<br/> But Braggadochio with his bloody launce<br/> Once having turnd, no more returnd his face,<br/> But lefte his love to losse, and fled him selfe him selfe apace. <br/><br/>The knight him seeing flie, had no regard<br/> Him to poursew, but to the lady rode,<br/> And having her from Trompart lightly reard,<br/> Vpon his Courser sett the lovely lode,<br/> And with her fled away without abode. <br/>Well weened he, that fairest Florimell<br/> It was, with whom in company he yode,<br/> And so her selfe her selfe did alwaies to him tell;<br/> So made him thinke him selfe him selfe in heven, that was in hell. <br/><br/>But Florimell her selfe her selfe was far away,<br/> Driven to great distresse by fortune straunge,<br/> And taught the carefull Mariner to play,<br/> Sith late mischaunce had her compeld to chaunge<br/> The land for sea, at randon there to raunge:<br/> Yett there that cruell Queene avengeresse,<br/> Not satisfyde so far her to estraunge<br/> From courtly blis and wonted happinesse,<br/> Did heape on her new waves of weary wretchednesse. <br/><br/>For being fled into the fishers bote,<br/> For refuge from the Monsters cruelty,<br/> Long so she on the mighty maine did flote,<br/> And with the tide drove forward carelesly,<br/> For th'ayre was milde, and cleared was the skie,<br/> And all his windes Dan Aeolus did keepe,<br/> From stirring up their stormy enmity,<br/> As pittying to see her waile and weepe;<br/> But all the while the fisher did securely sleepe. <br/><br/>At last when droncke with drowsinesse, he woke,<br/> And saw his drover drive along the streame,<br/> He was dismayd, and thrise his brest he stroke,<br/> For marueill of that accident extreame;<br/> But when he saw, that blazing beauties beame,<br/> Which with rare light his bote did beautifye,<br/> He marueild more, and thought he yet did dreame<br/> Not well awakte, or that some extasye<br/> Assotted had his sence, or dazed was his eye. <br/><br/>But when her well avizing, hee peceived<br/> To be no vision, nor fantasticke sight,<br/> Great comfort of her presence he conceived,<br/> And felt in his old corage new delight<br/> To gin awake, and stir his frosen spright:<br/> Tho rudely askte her, how she thether came. <br/>Ah (sayd she) father I note read aright,<br/> What hard misfortune brought me to this same;<br/> Yet am I glad that here I now in fafety ame. <br/><br/>But thou good man, sith far in sea we bee,<br/> And the great waters gin apace to swell,<br/> That now no more we can the mayn-land see,<br/> Have care, I pray, to guide the cock-bote well,<br/> Least worse on sea then us on land befell,<br/> Thereat th'old man did nought but fondly grin,<br/> And saide, his boat the way could wisely tell:<br/> But his deceiptfull eyes did never lin,<br/> To looke on her faire face, and marke her snowy skin. <br/><br/>The sight whereof in his congealed flesh,<br/> Infixt such secrete sting of greedy lust,<br/> That the drie withered stocke it gan refresh,<br/> And kindled heat, that soone in flame forth brust:<br/> The driest wood is soonest burnt to dust. <br/>Rudely to her he lept, and his rough hand<br/> Where ill became him, rashly would have thrust,<br/> But she with angry scorne him did withstond,<br/> And shamefully reproved for his ru denes fond. <br/><br/>But he, that never good nor maners knew,<br/> Her sharpe rebuke full litle did esteeme;<br/> Hard is to teach an old horse amble trew. <br/>The inward smoke, that did before but steeme,<br/> Broke into open fire and rage extreme,<br/> And now he strength gan adde unto his will,<br/> Forcing to doe, that did him fowle misseeme:<br/> Beastly he threwe her downe, ne cared to spill<br/> Her garments gay with scales of fish, that all did fill. <br/><br/>The silly virgin strove him to withstand,<br/> All that she might, and him in vaine revild:<br/> Sheestrugled strongly both with foote and hand,<br/> To save her honor from that villaine vilde,<br/> And cride to heven, from humane helpe exild. <br/>O ye brave knights, that boast this Ladies love,<br/> Where be ye now, when she is nigh defild<br/> Of filthy wretch? well may she you reprove<br/> Of falsehood or of slouth, when most it may behove. <br/><br/>But if that thou, Sir Satyran, didst weete,<br/> Or thou, Sir Peridure, her sory state,<br/> How soone would yee assemble many a fleete,<br/> To fetch from sea, that ye at land lost late;<br/> Towres, citties, kingdomes ye would rvinate,<br/> In your avengement and dispiteous rage,<br/> Ne ought your burning fury mote abate;<br/> But if Sir Calidore could it presage,<br/> No living creature could his cruelty asswage. <br/><br/>But sith that none of all her knights is nye,<br/> See how the heavens of voluntary grace,<br/> And soveraine favor towards chastity,<br/> Doesuccor send to her distressed cace:<br/> So much high God doth innocence embrace. <br/>It fortuned, whilest thus she stifly strove,<br/> And the wide sea importuned long space<br/> With shrilling

then she said she loved none, but a Faery knight. <br/><br/>Then like a 〈◊〉 knight him selfe him selfe he drest;<br/> For every shape on him he could endew:<br/> Then like a king he was to her exprest,<br/> And offred kingdoms unto her in vew,<br/> To be his Leman and his Lady trew:<br/> But when all this he nothing saw prevaile,<br/> With harder meanes he cast her to subdew,<br/> And with

all<br/> He els could doe, he saw him selfe him selfe esteemd,<br/> Downe in a Dongeon deepe he let her fall,<br/> And threatned there to make her his eternall thrall. <br/><br/>Eternall thraldome was to her more liefe,<br/> Then losse of chastitie, or chaunge of love:<br/> Dye had she rather in tormenting griefe,<br/> Then any should of falsenesse her reprove,<br/> Or loosenes, that she lightly did remove. <br/>Most vertuous virgin, glory be thy meed,<br/> And crowne of heavenly prayse with Saintes above,<br/> Where most sweet hymmes of this thy famous deed<br/> Are still emongst them song,

So had he serued many one. <br/><br/>The gentle Lady. loose at randon lefte,<br/> The greene-wood long did walke, and wander wide<br/> At wilde aduenture, like a forlorne wefte,<br/> Till on a day the Satyres her espide<br/> Straying alone withouten groome or guide;<br/> Her up they tooke, and with them home her ledd,<br/> With them as house wife ever to abide,<br/> To milk their gotes, and make them cheese & bredd,<br/> And every one as commune good her handeled. <br/><br/>That shortly she 〈◊〉 has forgott,<br/> And eke Sir 〈◊〉, all were he deare;<br/> Who from her went to seeke another lott,<br/> And now by fortune was arrived here,<br/> Where those two guilers with Malbecco were:<br/> Soone as the oldman saw Sir Paridell,<br/> He fainted, and was almost dead with feare,<br/> Ne word he had to speake, his griefe to tell,<br/> But to him louted low, and greeted goodly well. <br/><br/>And after asked him for Hellenore,<br/> I take no keepe of her (sayd Paridell)<br/> She wonneth in the forrest there before. <br/>So forth he rode, as his aduenture fell;<br/> The whiles the Boaster from his loftie sell<br/> Faynd to alight, something amisse to mend;<br/> But the fresh Swayne would not his leasure dwell,<br/> But went his way; whom when he passed kend,<br/> He up remounted light, and after faind to wend. <br/><br/>Per dy nay (said Malbecco) shall ye not:<br/> But let him passe as lightly, as he came:<br/> For litle good of him is to be got,<br/> And mickle perill to bee put to shame. <br/>But let us goe to seeke my dearest Dame,<br/> Whom he hath left in yonder forest wyld:<br/> For 〈◊〉 her safety in great doubt I ame,<br/> Least saluage beastes her person have despoyld:<br/> Then all the world is lost, and we in vaine have toyld. <br/><br/>They all agree, and forward them addrest:<br/> Ah but (said crafty Trompart) weete ye well,<br/> That yonder in that faithfull wildernesse<br/> Huge monsters haunt, and many dangers dwell;<br/> Dragons, and Minotaures, and feendes of hell,<br/> And many wilde woodmen, which robbe & rend<br/> All traveilers; therefore aduise ye well,<br/> Before ye enterprise that way to wend:<br/> One may his iourney bring too soone to evill end. <br/><br/>Malbecco stopt in great astonishment,<br/> And with pale eyes fast fixed on the rest,<br/> Their counsell craved, in daunger imminent. <br/>Said Trompart, you that are the most opprest<br/> With burdein of great treasure, I thinke best<br/> Here for to stay in safetie behynd;<br/> My Lord and I will search the wide forest. <br/>That counsell pleased not Malbeccoes mynd;<br/> For he was much afraid, him selfe him selfe alone to fynd. <br/><br/>Then is it best (said he) that ye doe leave<br/> Your treasure here in some security,<br/> Either fast closed in some hollow greave,<br/> Or buried in the ground from ieopardy,<br/> Till we returne againe in safety:<br/> As for us two, least doubt of us ye have,<br/> Hence farre away we will blyndfolded ly,<br/> Ne privy bee unto your treasures grave. <br/>It pleased: so he did. Then they march forward brave. <br/><br/>Now when amid the thickest woodes they were,<br/> They heard a noyse of many bagpipes shrill,<br/> And shrieking Hububs them approching nere,<br/> Which all the forest did with horrour 〈◊〉:<br/> That dreadfull sound the 〈◊〉 hart did thrill,<br/> With such amazment, that in hast he fledd,<br/> Ne ever looked back for good or ill,<br/> And after him eke fearefull Trompart spedd;<br/> The old man could not fly, but fell to ground half dedd. <br/><br/>Yet afterwardes close creeping, as he might,<br/> He in a bush did hyde his fearefull hedd,<br/> The

huge Geaunt, that with hideous<br/> And hatefull outrage long him chaced thus;<br/> It was that Ollyphant, the brother deare<br/> Of that Argante vile and vitious,<br/> From whom the Squyre of Dames was reft whylere;<br/> This all as bad as she, and worse, if worse ought were. <br/><br/>For as the sister did in feminine<br/> And filthy lust exceede all woman kinde,<br/> So he surpassed his sex

the Gyaunt saw, he soone resinde<br/> His former svit, and from them fled apace;<br/> They after both, and boldly bad him bace,<br/> And each did strive the other to outgoe;<br/> But he them both outran a wondrous space,<br/> For he was long, and swift as any Roe,<br/> And now made better speed, t'escape his feared foe. <br/><br/>It was not Satyrane, whom he did feare,<br/> But Britomart the

in thousand peeces fondly rent,<br/> And all the world with flashing fire brent:<br/> So like, that all the walles did seeme to flame. <br/>Yet cruell Cupid, not herewith content,<br/> Forst him estsoones to follow other game,<br/> And love a Shephards daughter for his dearest Dame. <br/><br/>He loved Isse for his dearest Dame,<br/> And for her sake her cattell fedd a while,<br/> And for her

creame,<br/> Did shine with siluer, and shoot forth his beame. <br/>The God himselfe did pensive seeme and sad,<br/> And hong adowne his head, as he did dreame:<br/> For privy love his brest empierced had,<br/> Ne ought but deare Bisaltis ay could make him glad. <br/><br/>He loved eke Iphimedia deare,<br/> And Aeolus faire daughter Arne hight,<br/> For whom he turnd him selfe him selfe into a Steare,<br/> And fedd on fodder, to beguile her sight. <br/>Also to win Deucalions daughter bright,<br/> He turnd him selfe him selfe into a Dolphin fayre;<br/> And like a winged horse he tooke his flight,<br/> To snaky-locke Medusa to repayre,<br/> On whom he got faire Pegasus, that flitteth in the ayre. <br/><br/>Next Saturne was, (but who would ever weene,<br/> That sullein Saturne ever weend to love? <br/>Yet love is sullein, and Saturnlike seene,<br/> As he did for Erigone it prove. <br/>That to a Centaure did him selfe him selfe transmove. <br/>So prooved it eke that gratious God of wine,<br/> When for to compasse Philliras hard love,<br/> He turnd himselfe into a fruitfull vine,<br/> And into her faire bosome made his grapes decline. <br/><br/>Long were to tell the amorous assayes,<br/> And gentle pangues, with which he maked meeke<br/> The mightie Mars, to learne his wanton playes:<br/> How oft for Venus, and how often eek<br/> For many other Nymphes hesore did shreek,<br/> With womanish teares, and with unwarlike smarts,<br/> Privily moystening his horrid cheeke. <br/>There was he painted full of burning dartes,<br/> And many wide woundes launched through his inner partes. <br/><br/>Ne did he spare (so cruell was the Elfe)<br/> His owne deare mother, (ah why should he so?) <br/>Ne did he spare sometime to pricke himselfe,<br/> That he might taste the sweet consuming woe,<br/> Which he had wrought to many others moe. <br/>But to declare the mournfull Tragedyes,<br/> And spoiles, wherewith he all the ground did strow,<br/> More eath to number, with how many eyes<br/> High heven beholdes sad lovers nightly theeveryes. <br/><br/>Kings Queenes, Lords Ladies, knights & Damsels gent<br/> Were heaped together with the vulgar sort,<br/> And mingled with the raskall rablement,<br/> Without respect of person or of port,<br/> To shew Dan Cupids powre and great effort:<br/> And round about a border was entrayld,<br/> Of broken bowes and-arrowes shivered short,<br/> And a long bloody river through them rayld,<br/> So lively and so like, that living sence it fayld. <br/><br/>And at the upper end of that faire rowme,<br/> There was an Altar bvilt of pretious stone,<br/> Of passing valew, and of great renowme,<br/> On which there stood an Image all alone,<br/> Of massy gold, which with his owne light shone;<br/> And winges it had with sondry colours dight,<br/> More sondry colours, then the proud Pavone<br/> Beares in his boasted fan, or Iris bright,<br/> When her discolourd bow she spreds through heven bright. <br/><br/>Blyndfold he was, and in his cruell fist<br/> A mortall bow and arrowes keene did hold,<br/> With which he shot at randon, when him list,<br/> Some headed with sadlead, some with pure gold;<br/> (Ah man beware, how thou those dartes behold)<br/> A wounded Dragon under him didly,<br/> Whose hideous tayle his lefte foot did enfold,<br/> And with a shaft was shot through either eye,<br/> That no man forth might draw, ne no man remedye. <br/><br/>And underneath his feet was written thus,<br/> Vnto the Victor of the Gods this bee:<br/> And all the people in that ample hous<br/> Did to that image bowe their humble knee,<br/> And oft committed fowle Idolatree. <br/>That wondrous sight faire Britomart amazd,<br/> Ne seeing could her wonder satisfie,<br/> But evermore and more upon it gazd,<br/> The whiles the passing brightnes her fraile sences dazd. <br/><br/>Tho as she backward cast her busie eye,<br/> To search each secrete of that goodly sted<br/> Ouer the dore thus written she did spye<br/> Bee bold: she oft and oft it over-red<br/> Yet could not find what sence it figured:<br/> But what so were therein, or writ or ment,<br/> She was no whit thereby discouraged,<br/> From prosecuting of her first intent,<br/> But forward with bold steps into the next roome went. <br/><br/>Much fayrer, then the former, was that roome,<br/> And richlier by many partes arayd:<br/> For not with arras made in painefull loome,<br/> But with pure gold it all was overlayd,<br/> Wrought with wilde Antickes, which their follies playd,<br/> In the rich metall, as they living were:<br/> A thousand monstrous formes therein were made,<br/> Such as false love doth oft upon him weare,<br/> For love in thousand mōstrous formes doth oft appeare. <br/><br/>And all about, the glistring walles were hong<br/> With warlike spoiles, and with victorious prayes,<br/> Of mightie Conquerours and Captaines strong,<br/> Which were whilome captived in their dayes,<br/> To cruell love, and wrought their owne decayes:<br/> Their swerds & speres were broke, & hauberques rent<br/> And their proud girlonds of tryumphant bayes,<br/> Troden in dust with fury insolent,<br/> To shew the victors might and mercilesse intent. <br/><br/>The warlike Mayd beholding earnestly<br/> The goodly ordinaunce of this rich Place,<br/> Did greatly wonder, ne could satisfy<br/> Her greedy eyes with gazing a long space,<br/> But more she meruaild that no footings 〈◊〉,<br/> Nor wight appeared, but wastefull emptinesse,<br/> And solemne silence over all that place:<br/> Straunge thing it seemed, that none was to possesse<br/> So rich purueyaunce, ne them keepe with carefulnesse. <br/><br/>And as she lookt about, she did behold,<br/> How over that same dore was likewise writ,<br/> Be bolde, be bolde, and every where Be bold,<br/> That much she muzed, yet could not construe it<br/> By any ridling skill, or commune wit. <br/>At last she spyde at that rowmes upper end,<br/> Another yron dore, on which was writ,<br/> Be not too bold; whereto though she did bend<br/> Her earnest minde, yet wist not what it might intend. <br/><br/>Thus she there wayted untill eventyde,<br/> Yet living creature none she saw appeare:<br/> And now sad shadowes gan the world to hyde<br/> From mortall vew, and wrap in darkenes dreare;<br/> Yet nould she d'off her weary armes, for feare<br/> Of secret daunger, ne let sleepe oppresse<br/> Her heavy eyes with natures burdein deare,<br/> But drew herselfe aside in sickernesse,<br/> And her welpointed wepons did about her dresse. <br/>Cant. XII.<br/><br/><br/>The maske of Cupid, and th'enchanted<br/> Chamber are displayd,<br/> Whence Britomart redeemes faire<br/> Amoret, through charmes decayd. <br/><br/>THo when as chearelesse Nighty coucred had<br/> Fayre heaven with an universall clowd,<br/> That every wight dismayd with darkenes sad,<br/> In silence and in sleepe themselues did shrowd,<br/> She heard a shrilling Trompet sound alowd,<br/> Signe of nigh battaill, or got victory;<br/> Nought therewith daunted was her courage prowd,<br/> But rather stird to cruell enmity,<br/> Expecting ever, when some foe she might descry. <br/><br/>With that, an hideous storme of winde arose,<br/> With dreadfull thunder and lightning atwixt,<br/> And an earthquake, as if it streight would lose<br/> The worlds foundations from his centre fixt;<br/> A direfull stench of smoke and sulphure mixt<br/> Ensewd, whose noyaunce fild the fearefull sted,<br/> From the fourth howre of night untill the sixt;<br/> Yet the bold Britonesse was nought ydred,<br/> Though much emmoved, but stedfast still persevered. <br/><br/>All suddeinly a stromy whirlwind blew<br/> Throughout the house, that clapped every dore,<br/> With which that yron wicket open flew,<br/> As it with mighty levers had bene 〈◊〉:<br/> And forth yssewd, as on the readie flore<br/> Of some Theatre, a grave personage,<br/> That in his hand a braunch of laurell bore,<br/> With comely haveour and count'nance 〈◊〉,<br/> Yclad in costly garments, fit for 〈◊〉 Stage. <br/><br/>Proceeding to the midst, he stil did stand,<br/> As if in minde he somewhat had to say,<br/> And to the vulgare beckning with his hand,<br/> In signe of silence, as to heare a play,<br/> By lively actions he gan bewray<br/> Some argument of matter passioned;<br/> Which doen, he backe retyred soft away,<br/> And passing by, his name 〈◊〉,<br/> Ease, on his robe in golden letters cyphered. <br/><br/>The noble Mayd, still standing all this vewd,<br/> And merueild at his straunge intendiment;<br/> With that a ioyous fellowship issewd<br/> Of Minstrales, making goodly meriment,<br/> With wanton Bardes, and Rymers impudent,<br/> All which together song full chearefully<br/> A lay of loves delight, with sweet concent:<br/> After whom marcht a iolly company,<br/> In manner of a maske, enranged orderly. <br/><br/>The whiles a most delitious harmony,<br/> In full straunge notes was sweetly heard to sound,<br/> That the rare sweetnesse of the melody<br/> The feeble sences wholy did confound,<br/> And the frayle soule in deepe delight nigh drownd:<br/> And when it ceast, shrill trompets lowd did bray,<br/> That their report did far away rebound,<br/> And when they ceast, it gan againe to play,<br/> The whiles the maskers marched forth in trim aray. <br/><br/>The first was Fansy, like a lovely Boy,<br/> Of rare aspect, and beautie without peare,<br/> Matchable ether to that ympe of Troy,<br/> Whom jove did love, and chose his cup to beare,<br/> Or that same daintie 〈◊〉, which was so deare<br/> To great Alcides, that when as he dyde,<br/> He wailed womanlike with many a teare,<br/> And every word, and every valley wyde<br/> He fild with Hylas name; the Ny mphes eke Hylas cryde. <br/><br/>His garment nether was of silke nor say,<br/> But paynted plumes, in goodly order dight,<br/> Like as the 〈◊〉 Indians do aray<br/> Their tawney bodies, in their proudest plight:<br/> As those same plumes, so seemd he vaine and light,<br/> That by his gate might easily appeare;<br/> For still he fared as dauncing in delight,<br/> And in his hand a windy fan did 〈◊〉,<br/> That in the ydle ayre he moved still here and theare. <br/><br/>And him beside marcht amorous Desyre,<br/> Who seemd of ryper yeares, then th'other Swayne,<br/> Yet was that others swayne this elders syre,<br/> And gave him being, commune to them twayne:<br/> His garment was disguysed very vayne,<br/> And his embrodered Bonet sat awry;<br/> Twixt both his hands few sparks he close did strayne,<br/> Which still he blew, and kindled busily,<br/> That soone they life conceived, and forth in flames did fly. <br/><br/>Next after him went Doubt, who was yclad<br/> In a discoloured cote, of straunge disguyse,<br/> That at his 〈◊〉 a brode Capuccio had,<br/> And sleeves dependaunt Albanese-wyse:<br/> He lookt askew with his mistrustfull eyes,<br/> And nycely trode, as thornes lay in his way<br/> Or that the flore to shrinke he did avyse<br/> And on a broken reed he still did stay,<br/> His feeble steps, which shrunck, when hard thereon he lay. <br/><br/>With him went <span

Wardein of the Stanneryes, and her Maiesties liefetenaunt of the County of Cornewayll.<br/>SIr knowing how doubtfully all Allegories may be construed, and this booke of mine, which I have entituled the Faery Queene, being a continued Allegory, or darke conceit, I have thought good aswell for avoyding of gealous opinions and miscō structions, as also for your better light in reading therof, (being so by you cōmanded,) to discover unto you the general intention & meaning, which in the whole course thereof I have fashioned, without expressing of any particular purposes or by accidents therein occasioned. The generall end therefore of all the booke is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline: Which for that I conceived shoulde be most plausible and pleasing, being coloured with an historicall fiction, the which the most part of men delight to read, rather for variety of matter, then for profite of the exsample: I chose the historye of king Arthure, as most fitte for the excellency of his person, being made famous by many mens former workes, and also furthest from the daunger of enuy, and suspition of present time. In which I have followed all the antique Poets historicall, first Homere, who in the Persons of Agamemnon and Vlysses hath ensampled a good governour and a vertuous man, the one in his Ilias, the other in his Odysseis: then Virgil, whose like intention was to doe in the person of Aeneas: after him Ariosto comprised them both in his Orlando: and lately Tasso dissevered them againe, and formed both parts in two persons, namely that part which they in Philosophy call Ethice, or vertues of a private man, coloured in his Rinaldo: The other named Politice in his Godfredo. By ensample of which excellente Poets, I labour to pourtraict in Arthure, before he was king, the image of a brave knight, perfected in the twelue private morall vertues, as Aristotle hath devised, the which is the purpose of these first twelue bookes: which if I finde to be well accepted, I may be perhaps encoraged, to frame the other part of polliticke vertues in his person, after that hee came to be king. To some I know this Methode will seeme displeasaunt, which had rather have good discipline delivered plainly in way of precepts, or sermoned at large, as they use, then thus clowdily enwrapped in All goricall devises. But such, me seeme, should be satisfide with the use of these dayes, seeing all things accounted by their showes, and nothing esteemed of, that is not delightfull and pleasing to commune sence. For this cause is Xenophon preferred before Plato, for that the one in the exquisite depth of his iudgement, formed a Commune welth such as it should be, but the other in the person of Cyrus and the Persians fashioned a governement such as might best be: So much more profitable and gratious is doctrine by ensample, then by rule. So have I laboured to doe in the person of Arthure: whome I conceive after his long education by Timon, to whom he was by Merlin delivered to be brought up, so soone as he was borne of the Lady Igrayne, to have seene in a dream or vision the Faery Queen, with whose excellent beauty ravished, he awaking resolued to seeke her out, and so being by Merlin armed, and by Timon throughly instructed, he went to seeke her forth in Faerye land. In that Faery Queene I meane glory in my generall intention, but in my particular I conceive the most excellent and glorious person of our soveraine the Queene, and her kingdome in Faery land. And yet in some places el, I doe otherwise shadow her. For considering she beareth two persons, the one of a most royall Queene or Empresse, the other of a most vertuous and beautifull Lady, this latter part in some places I doe ezpresse in Belphoebe, fashioning her name according to your owne excellent conceipt of Cynthia, (Phaebe and Cynthia being both names of Diana.) So in the person of Prince Arthure I sette forth magnificence in particular, which vertue for that (according to Aristotle and the rest) it is the perfection of all the rest, and conteineth in it them all, therefore in the whole course I mention the deedes of Arthure app'yable to that vertue, which I write of in that booke. But of the xii. other vertues, I make xii. other knight the patrones, for the more variety of the history: Of which these three bookes contayn three. The first of the knight of the 〈◊〉, in whome I expresse Holynes: The seconde of 〈◊〉 Guyon, in whome I sette forth Temperaunce: The third of Britomartis a Lady knight, in whome I picture Chastity. But because the beginning of the whole worke seemeth abrupte and as depending upon other antecedents, it needs that ye know the occasion of these three knights severall aduentures. For the Methode of a Poet historical is not such, as of an Historiographer.

The beginning therefore of my history, if it were to be told by an Historiographer should be the twelfth booke which is the last, where I devise that the Faery Queene kept her Annuall feaste xii. dayes, uppon which xii. severall dayes, the occasions of the xii. severall aduentures hapned, which being undertaken by xii. severall knights, are in these xii books severally handled and 〈◊〉. The first was this. In the beginning of the feast, there presented him selfe him selfe a tall clownishe younge man, who falling before the Queen of Faries desired a boone (as the manner then was) which during that feast she might not refuse: which was that hee might have the atchievement of any aduenture, which during that feaste should hapmpen, that being graunted, he rested him on the floore, unfitte through his rusticity for a better place. 〈◊〉 after entred a faire Ladye in mourning weedes, riding on a white Asse, with a dwarfe behind her leading a warlike steed, that bore the Armes of a knight, and his speare in the dwarfes hand. Shee falling before the Queene of Faeries, complayned that her father and mother an ancient King and Queene, had bene by an huge dragon many years shut up in a brasen Castle, who thence suffred them not to yssew: and therefore besought the Faery Queene to assygne her some one of her knights to take on him that exployt. Presently that clownish person upstarting, desired that aduenture: whereat the Queene much wondering, and the Lady much gainesaying, yet he earnestly importuned his desire. In the end the Lady told him that unlesse that armour which she brought, would 〈◊〉 him (that is the armour of a Christian man specified by Saint Paul u. Ephes.) that he could not succeed in that enterprise, which being forthwith put upon him with dewe furnitures thereunto, he seemed the goodliest man in al that company, and was well liked of the Lady. And eftesoones taking on him knighthood, and mounting on that straunge Courser, he went forth with her on that aduenture: where beginneth the first booke, uz.<br/>A gentle knight was pricking on the playne. &c. <br/>The second day ther came in a Palmer bearing an Infant with bloody hands, whose Parents he complained to have bene slayn by an Enchaunteresse called Acrasia: and therfore craved of the Faery Queene, to appoint him some knight, to performe that aduenture, which being assigned to Sir Guyon, he presently went forth with that same Palmer: which is the beginning of the second booke and the whole subiect thereof. The third day there came in, a Groome who complained before the Faery Queene, that a 〈◊〉 Enchaunter called Busirane had in hand a most faire Lady called Amoretta, whom he kept in most grievous torment, because she would not yield him the pleasure of her body. Whereupon Sir Scudamour the lover of that Lady presently tooke on him that aduenture. But being unable to performe it by reason of the hard Enchauntments, after long sorrow, in the end met with Britomartis, who succoured him, and reskewed his love.<br/>But by occasion hereof, many other aduentures are intermedled, but rather as Accidents, then intendments. As the love of Britomart, the overthrow of Marinell, the misery of Florimell, the vertuousnes of 〈◊〉, the lasciviousnes of Hellenora, and many the like.<br/>Thus much Sir, I have briefly overronne to direct your understanding to the <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">wel-head</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">of</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">the</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">History</span><span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">,</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">that</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">from</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">thence</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">gathering</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">the</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">whole</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">intention</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">of</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">the</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">conceit</span><span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">,</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">ye</span> <span class="links" link_data="812,A20926">may</span> as in a handfull gripe al the discourse, which otherwise may happily seeme tedious and confused.
