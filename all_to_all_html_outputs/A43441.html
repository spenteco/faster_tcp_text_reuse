quickly we'll undresse<br/> To one and th'others nakednesse. <br/>And ravisht, plunge into the bed,<br/> (Bodies and souls commingled)<br/> And kissing, so as none may heare,<br/> We'll weary all the Fables there. <br/>His wish.<br/><br/>IT is sufficient if we pray<br/> To Jove, who gives, and takes away:<br/> Let him the Land and Living finde;<br/> Let me alone to fit the mind. <br/>His

Virgins hands have drawn<br/> O'r it a Cobweb-Lawne:<br/> And here, you see, this Lilly shows,<br/> Tombed in a Christal stone,<br/> More faire in this transparent case,<br/> Then when it grew alone;<br/> And had but single grace. <br/><br/>You see how Creame but naked is;<br/> Nor daunces in the eye<br/> Without a Strawberrie:<br/> Or some fine tincture, like to this,<br/> Which draws the sight thereto,<br/> More by that wantoning with it;<br/> Then when the paler hieu<br/> No mixture did admit. <br/><br/>You see how Amber through the streams<br/> More gently stroaks the sight,<br/> With some concealed delight;<br/> Then when he darts his radiant beams<br/> Into the boundlesse aire:<br/> Where either too much light his worth<br/> Doth all at once impaire,<br/> Or set it little forth. <br/><br/>Put Purple Grapes, or Cherries in -<br/> To Glasse, and they will send<br/> More beauty to commend<br/> Them, from that cleane and subtile skin,<br/> Then if they naked stood,<br/> And had no other pride at all,<br/> But their own flesh and blood,<br/> And tinctures naturall. <br/><br/>Thus Lillie, Rose, Grape, Cherry, Creame,<br/> And Straw-berry do stir<br/> More love, when they transfer<br/> A weak, a soft, a broken beame;<br/> Then if they shoed discover<br/> At full their proper excellence;<br/> Without some Scean cast over,<br/> To juggle with the sense. <br/><br/>Thus let this Christaled Lillie be<br/> A Rule, how far to teach,<br/> Your nakednesse must reach:<br/> And that, no further, then we see<br/> Those glaring colours laid<br/> By Arts wise hand, but to this end<br/> They shoed obey a shade;<br/> Lest they too far extend. <br/><br/>So though y'are white as Swan, or Snow,<br/> And have the power to move<br/> A world of men to love:<br/> Yet, when your Lawns & Silks shal flow;<br/> And that white cloud divide<br/> Into a doubtful Twi-light; then,<br/> Then will your hidden Pride<br/> Raise greater fires in men. <br/>To his Booke.<br/><br/>LIke to a Bride, come forth my Book, at last,<br/> With all thy richest jewels over-cast:<br/> Say, if there be 'mongst many jems here; one<br/> Deservelesse of the name of Paragon:<br/> Blush not at all for that; since we have set<br/> Some Pearls on Queens, that have been counterfet. <br/>Upon some women.<br/><br/>THou who wilt not love, doe this;<br/> Learne of me

 <br/>The nails faln off by Whit-flawes: Art's<br/> Wise hand enchasing here those warts. <br/>Which we to others (from our selves our selves)<br/> Sell, and brought hither by the Elves. <br/>The tempting Mole, stoln from the neck<br/> Of the shie Virgin, seems to deck<br/> The holy Entrance; where within<br/> The roome is hung with the blew skin<br/> Of shifted Snake: enfreezed throughout<br/> With eyes of Peacocks Trains, & Trout-flies curious wings; and these among<br/> Those silver-pence, that cut the tongue<br/> Of the red infant, neatly hung. <br/>The glow-wormes eyes; the shining scales<br/> Of silu'rie fish; wheat-strawes, the snailes<br/> Soft Candle-light; the Kitling's eyne;<br/> Corrupted wood; serve here for shine. <br/>No glaring light of bold-fac't Day,<br/> Or other over radiant Ray<br/> Ransacks this roome; but what weak beams<br/> Can make reflected from these jems,<br/> And multiply; Such is the light,<br/> But ever doubtfull Day, or night. <br/>By this quaint Taper-light he winds<br/> His Errours up; and now he finds<br/> His Moon-tanned Mab, as somewhat sick,<br/> And (Love knowes) tender as a chick. <br/>Upon six plump Dandillions, high -<br/> Reared, lyes her Elvish-majestie:<br/> Whose woollie-bubbles seemed to drowne<br/> Hir Mab-ship in obedient Downe. <br/>For either sheet, was spread the Caule<br/> That doth the Infants face enthrall,<br/> When it is born: (by some enstyled<br/> The luckie Omen of the child)<br/> And next to these two blankets ore -<br/> Cast of the finest Gossamore. <br/>And then a Rug of carded wooll,<br/> Which, Spunge-like drinking in the dull -<br/> Light of the Moon, seemed to comply,<br/> Cloud-like, the daintie Deitie. <br/>Thus soft she lies: and over-head<br/> A Spinners circle is bespread,<br/> With Cob-web-curtains: from the roof<br/> So neatly sunck, as that no proof<br/> Of any tackling can declare<br/> What gives it hanging in the Aire. <br/>The Fringe about this, are those Threds<br/> Broke at the Losse of Maiden-heads:<br/> And all behung with these pure Pearls,<br/> Dropt from the eyes of ravisht Girles<br/> Or writhing Brides; when, (panting) they<br/> Give unto Love the straiter way. <br/>For Musick now; He has the cries<br/> Of fained-lost-Virginities;<br/> The which the Elves make to excite<br/> A more unconquered appetite. <br/>The Kings undrest; and now upon<br/> The Gnats-watch-word the Elves are gone. <br/>And now the bed, and Mab possest<br/> Of this great-little-kingly-Guest. <br/>We'll nobly think, what's to be done,<br/> He'll do no doubt; This flax is spun. <br/>To his peculiar friend Master Thomas Shapcott, Lawyer.<br/><br/>I'Ve paid Thee, what I promised; that's not All;<br/> Besides I give Thee here a Verse that shall<br/> (When

King.<br/><br/>GIve way, give way, now, now my Charles shines here,<br/> A Publike Light (in this immensive Sphere.) <br/>Some starres were fixt before; but these are dim,<br/> Compared (in this my ample Orbe) to Him. <br/>Draw in your feeble fiers, while that He<br/> Appeares but in His Meaner Majestie. <br/>Where, if such glory flashes from His Name,<br/> Which is His Shade, who can abide His Flame! <br/>Princes, and such like Publike Lights as these,<br/> Must not be lookt on, but at distances:<br/> For, if we gaze on These brave Lamps too neer,<br/> Our eyes they'l blind, or if not blind, they'l bleer. <br/>The Funerall Rites of the Rose.<br/><br/>THe Rose was sick, and smiling died;<br/> And (being to be sanctified)<br/> About the Bed, there sighing stood<br/> The sweet, and flowrie Sisterhood. <br/>Some hung the head, while some did bring<br/> (To wash her) water from the Spring. <br/>Some laid her forth, while other wept,<br/> But all a solemne Fast there kept. <br/>The holy Sisters some among<br/> The sacred Dirge and Trent all sung. <br/>But ah! what sweets smelt every where,<br/> As Heaven had spent all perfumes there. <br/>At last, when prayers for the dead,<br/> And Rites were all accomplished;<br/> They, weeping, spread a Lawnie Loome,<br/> And closed her up, as in a Tombe. <br/>The Rainbow: or curious Covenant.<br/><br/>MIne eyes, like clouds, were drizling raine,<br/> And as they thus did entertaine<br/> The gentle Beams from Julia's sight<br/> To mine eyes leveled opposite:<br/> O Thing admired! there did appeare<br/> A curious Rainbow smiling there;<br/> Which was the Covenant, that she<br/> No more woed drown mine eyes, or me. <br/>The last stroke strike sure.<br/><br/>THough by well-warding many blowes w'ave past,<br/> That stroke most feared is, which is struck the last. <br/>Fortune.<br/><br/>FOrtune's a blind profuser of her own,<br/> Too much she gives to some, enough to none. <br/><span class="links"
